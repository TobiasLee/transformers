The USA Today says "late this year". The question is, will hockey be moved to ESPN2 permenantly, or will it be where they have a game of the week on ESPN, and have a bunch of other games on ESPN2? -- Mike Cornell | "There are a great many people in the country today who, mac18@po.cwru.edu| through no fault of their own, are sane." -Monty Python	10
Have Belfour and Roenick done another disappearing act at chips are down time? When I saw them it looked like the Blackhawks' defense might carry them along way in the playoffs. Well they held St. Louis to 17 shots in game 2 and lost.	10
I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I thought it would help them win at least one playoff series. However, I don't think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come. Anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at least he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )	10

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive site. Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer. Here are the team goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993 These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date listed above. They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper every Tuesday. They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those are not verified. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

I used to work for the Stars. Minnesota supported the team to an extent. When I was there, we had quite afew sellouts (This was the season after the cup run and during the finals). Norm's main bitch was that there wasn't enough luxury suites. And, the ones he had were not always full. He wanted more boxes and wanted them full. He was just asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games at High Schools for $5 or college for about $10 that would probably be better.

ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage and I agree with all of you. Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing. We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck. I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It sucks, I mean really sucks!!! ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass. I was really pissed of about last night, coverage. I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck, so why show them? If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself. Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game. Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract obligations*, screw you ESPN. Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit! GO HAWKS!!!	10
I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice. Did you see Mike Lupica's column in Sunday's news? My sentiments exactly. I think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire into their hearts next season. Either that or he's going to be kicking alot of butt! I'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly quiet (you know, doing the "lurking" thing). I don't have a sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either. I am a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the Garden throughout the Penguins' - led by Mario's 5 goals - decimation of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this season. Hurlbut was injured for quite a while. I'm not sure, but I think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and if so, like you, question why he wasn't used. I believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation factor. Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is not doing any REAL physical intimidation (I'd like to have a nickel for every time J.D. said 'They've got to take the body more'), you've got to at least have some illusions ;-( I agree and I don't know. Sorry, I don't agree with you here. I think Joey C. did a good job filling in when he was asked to. I can't imagine that it's easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer. I don't seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too much, or failing to clear the zone. He worked hard, and at least didn't make any rookie mistakes. As he said himself in an interview, he can only give what he has. and he did. Absolutely. I think attendance at the Garden was better on the last day of the season, than any average night for the Islanders. The man is awesome. In a way, I'm enjoying the playoffs more, now that the Rangers aren't in them. I can really appreciate all the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's on the opposing team. He deserves it all, as far as I'm concerned. - Mary	10
Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this year. I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes. I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.	10
Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge? A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt. He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes. Speaking of Chelios, I wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade. I also wish we still had Corson. Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the bench. Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently. I have no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with Carbonneau. Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck. Too bad nobody is in front most of the time. Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique gets knocked down? It's disgusting. We also have Lebeau (5'10", 172) getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3", 205) with no reply from the team, except to yell for a penalty. Dammit, Denis Savard threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked Sundin off-balance. When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's big trouble someplace... Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head. The third period at least provided something to look forward to. Habs won the period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game had started at 7:30. Hopefully they play that way at home. Roy made the saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team. -- dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca	10
from Matthew Rush: It's pretty obvious that Holik's hitting Barrasso was an accident. He was even apologizing for it immediately before the Penguins all jumped on him.	10

Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ? Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can make the big save at the right time. The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ? I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance.	10
Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal. Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump & pull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3 & could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Canadians are dead meat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. Tee it up Jacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st place, welcome to the Adams division.	10
It was NOT Krupp's skate. Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle, of the Blues. They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk, and Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just missed) the jugular. Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at his neck, blood on the ice. He'd been suffering from it for over a decade. He just wasn't diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to have some alcohol to help him sleep. Unfortunately, he'd just been put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier. It's amazing he lasted as long as he did. OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've checked is OK now. For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands over and over and still think they're dirty. He might check the oven ten times to be sure it's turned off. He might see a movie about something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his own life. Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes, but still needs it. He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days. (He felt it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without). In any event, he is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the Gulls (IHL). And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues, but I don't know where he is. Possibly in the IHL, but you'd best ask a Blues fan.	10
Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo. I still don't understand why Buffalo, but maybe it's lucky. :-) btw, they shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice. Although Blue did give some technical directions on its removal, motioning with his stick.	10
- - I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. - Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference - next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed - to concern the Oiler's future. - - Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement - with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, - Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that - the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to - renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. - - Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, - but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington. - - As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly - supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market - team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems - that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans - than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if - the team does move, there is no place more deserving than - Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand - realignment scheme of Bettman? - Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton. The government said that Pock is going nowhere! Why don't I believe the government? Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be Tory leader 9 years ago?	10
Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games.. I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve by next season... COBRA --	10
Could anyone post the game summary for the Sabres-Bruins game.	10
Welcome aboard! And, since I haven't seen this yet this year (but all preceding years), let me say:	10
fans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass from Kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up 3 (magic #) goals in the third period, rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and the Rangers giving up another powerplay goal! The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off Messier and the first line. Nemchinov is a perfect third line center. So who goes Beezer or Richter?	10
Apparently, the public workers' strike in St John's, Newfoundland is over. The strike has, since mid-January, forced the St John's Maple Leafs hockey team to play their home games in other cities such as Toronto, Cornwall and Charlottetown. They have been playing their playoff home games in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Leafs' management said that they COULD return to St John's for the second round.	10

Disaster! Finland was beaten by Czech 1-3 (0-0,1-1,0-2). Finland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the quarter final on wednesday 28th. Lack of scoring skills has been the major problem of team Finland throughout the tournament. Briza (goalie) was the MVP of the Czech team and Tikkanen was the MVP of the Finnish team.	10

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay. Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, were quite stoppable.	10
Reports in Ottawa today say that the Senators have come to a verbal agreement with last seasons first pick and 2nd overall choice Alexei Yashin on a 5 year deal. As well the Senators have signed their second round pick Chad Penney who is currently playing for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the Ontario Junior league playoffs.	10
The answer is in the FAQ for this group. nough said.	10
I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played with the Rangers in the '70s. This was the season that they put the Rangers crest and "modern-style" numbers on the jerseys instead of the "NEW YORK" or "RANGERS" block letters and two-colour numbers. He took #77 because the Rangers already had a #7. (Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the biggest uniform style change in a long time. This was before Pittsburgh and Vancouver changed their colours.) dwarf	10
Whoa. What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time. Ths is not so. Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he allowed a very cheap goal. If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period. NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves. If they did not, they would not be in the NHL in the first place. I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they are occasionally required. However, when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there are any legitimate excuses. I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant. I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal. In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal'. I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move. But it led to _one_ goal only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead. My main concern is the second goal. What you say about the skaters is absolutely true. But realize that the game was effectively *won*. You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities. They are not important when the final result is decided. If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups. Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go. The goalie is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him, sometimes without justification. But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal. WHO CARES? Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play? I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like. But if you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times. For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league. In fact, I agree that he is. I assume you are referring to me. However, I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy. I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments'. If you regard objective (and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.	10
As far as I can tell, he was right next to Bassen! Don't you guys love it when people like me come out of the woodwork...8^)	10
My respect for the power of the hockey gods is preventing me from commenting on the above, and for commenting on whether the guy Damphousse was traded for is on vacation or not. Perhaps Roger (demonstrably in contempt of the hockey gods and paying for it) dares a comment or two?	10
Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are good in general: 1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and "Basten" are down 3 zip. (even though there is a possibility either can still win their series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding). 2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some (really) good draft picks... :-( 3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES? 4. Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques arrogant ***'s, or are they really? 5. Smythe-what???? I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel night in and night out... We should see some Canucks/Jets/Flames action...! 6.

Yep, though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simple...last year I woofed when we went up 3-1 on the Canucks...and look where it got me. :) Domi got tossed in the 2nd with a high-sticking major. He had been playing with Kris King and Stu Barnes...and it was this line that was arguably the best in the first two games. Definitely a good thing...every little cheer helps, Evan. :) Good thing the net doesn't need a voice to operate...I won't have one Sunday night when I get home, I hope. White noise here we come! ;) One thing, I WILL say though...Vancouver can KEEP Steve Armitage and John Garrett as a broadcast team...those two are BAD, especially when you are spoiled by Don Wittman. (At least four or five times, Steve called Barnes Selanne. Whoops! :)	10
Yeah, they finally came to agreement on a contract. As soon as the ink was dry, he suddenly decided Kansas City was a neat place to be. (ergo, the "want to play for the national team" was a bargaining chip).	10
Awesome home record or not, you need to remember the 7th game last year at the Aud. I'd like to see some playoff games since I'm stuck in Buffalo at UB, but I think Boston isn't giving up so easy.	10
That would be Clint Malarchuck. It was speculated at the time, that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked), he never would have survived. Ditto, if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby. If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood there was. It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror. Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the NHL. He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway, and didn't play for too long afterward. Some people speculated that he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward. He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after that, and then I believe he retired. Anyone else? -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carol Boudreau #44 a.k.a. The X-Terminator boudreau@athena.mit.edu Go Flames! Rock the Kings!	10

ESPN never committed (and I never saw advertised) to a particular Thursday game. They had originally scheduled Bos-Buf, and that was somehow leaked on this net, but to my knowledge ESPN never publicly released a schedule until Monday when they announced Pitt-NJ Thursday and Boston-Buffalo Saturday.	10
I'm personally expecting Moog. Blue played fairly decent (alright spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience. What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the puck out (at the very least until your team scores) Blue didn't face that kind of pressure on Tuesday. The Bruins will come out storming that is for sure. I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad , As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting. There game plan is sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo..... IMHO Pat Ellis P.S. GO BRUINS GO UMAINE BLACK BEARS 42-1-2 NUMBER 1......

[stuff deleted] I think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post - namely, Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM in St. Louis. This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for St. Louis, and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made. We can give Quinn credit for being an opportunist here. [stuff about other trades deleted] How do you figure? Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year: They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points, they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent. (Specifically, if I remember correctly, third place teams). How does this make Vancouver more improved? Further, if I'm not mistaken, the Wings had more points than Vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).	10

According to "Quotations from Chairman Cherry", Don was playing in Springfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other player had his paid off, but not Don didn't want to. Don called the other player a "teacher's Pet", and the other player replied "Ah, that's just sour grapes".	10
Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen. For most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity, it was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game... Unfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits. At first, I immediately thought "5 and a game" because the hit _looked_ much more severe from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was. After seeing the replay, I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you slice it). If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten 5 and the game. This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty? I've never seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to). Now, if Probie decides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right? This was also bullshit. But once again, no replay. It was Rouse, btw. I'm really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s. when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake. Yes. The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit loss. I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the Wings have no excuses for Game 4. They should be the superior team. The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his stick in somebody's eye. That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an asshole when it comes to stickwork. Four lousy minutes. Bullshit call. Murray should send the tape in. Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out of him.	10
It's about time the boys got it together!! They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games. But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3. Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings. Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it's true! I have to admit that goaltending was the key. Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd. He also kept the rebounds to a minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals. Clark even looked like he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2. If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).	10
Absolute nonsense. The decision that was made was Pocklington's. He chose 20 mill over Gretzky. If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill. How do you know what he thinks (or thought)? The only "thought" that I can see that you have revealed is your own. You don't like Gretzky. Big deal. The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty. What the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the ref won't be fooled. I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like Lemieux to change his game. Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated type like Hull and Salami. --	10
I believe the NHL Draft is on or the June 18th weekend.	10
And won't they have to change their name to the "Steelers" or something. The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by the tire fire a few years back.	10
There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck should not be required of a true fan.A true fan would follow the team in troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team. When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have done in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the team. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my money on mediocre teams.	10

: Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't. Bowman is a great coach...Johnson, : a very good one. However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and : Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and : delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is : a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part. IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. (Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both of which came at exactly the right time. Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also keeps the egos in check. Just a couple of ideas.	10

2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it. Instead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of them in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly took turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios. 3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do that either. Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around flat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others also proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown, Blues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race. I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3. In fact, the only point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate the Blues. They scored and took the lead. Too bad it was Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties. When the Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.	10

Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle. He was one of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in 1992. He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in the WHL. However, I was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially in the third round. He certainly didn't look like NHL material...	10
Marcus Thuresson had 6 goals, 10 assists, 16 points and 22 PIM in 31 games this season for Leksand in the Swedish elite league. This was only 10th in point scoring for Leksand. Marcus (born May 31 1971, Ht 185 cm, Wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he might still start producing, but I think the Sharks may have done a bad trade here. Staffan	10
I agree! Rob Shick sucks big time. He did the same thing last night's game between Boston & Buffalo.	10
-=> Quoting Bill Gregory to All <=- BG> hey I saw that game! I thought the Sabres looked better that you BG> described. It's Boston that looked weak and unsure of themselves. Even BG> if (big if) they (bruins) win the third game what's that going to BG> prove? They be lucky! Well now the Sabres are up 3 - 0 in games, and its to bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as that could have been the best series of the playoffs, I think Boston will come out smoking in the next two games and that Buffalo will end the series in game six back in Buffalo, and say, how about those Islanders? they are up 2 - 1 on the Capitals and will probably win the series, only to be clobbered by the Penguins who should eliminate the Devils in the next game. I cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the Penguins this year (again) and they will take cup # 3 I'm afraid. well talk to ya later. Steve	10
cdash@moet.cs.colorado.edu (Charles Shub) writes... What really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth between baseball and hockey after they stated that they couldn't show the overtime period. I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey. Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey something like 30 minutes later. Are they trying to alienate both hockey and baseball viewers at the same time. As for Martinsville, I wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was no secret that it coincided with the draft. Why not let TNN broadcast it ? George	10
I agree thouroughly!! Screw the damn contractual agreements! Show the exciting hockey game. They will lose fans of ESPN (of which I have been one for quite a while) quickly with decisions like this. Just my $.02	10
Like many others I too was watching the Caps/Isles game when the went to the baseball game. I too was pissed. How could they interupt such an important game. I understand about contracts, but you would think they would have a clause in the contract concerning important games! Anyway, us BLUES (and Hawks) fans got shafted worse! While everyone in the U.S. and watched the game on ABC. However those of us who live in the central Illinois area were subjected to watching the Arthritus(?) Telethon. The area that was most affected by the telecast did not get to see the game except through HAWK VISION. This game, had it been televised, would have been the first home Hawks game shown in the area since 1980. This television BULL*&%$ has got to stop. We are not only being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but we are also being deprived of watching them on TV. PEACE, HAMMER	10

As she said, the letter is addressed to Bettman. The post (which, though having pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was addressed to all. When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will say "To: All". I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here. That's an entirely different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman. Unfortunately... The "largest computer networks in the world" phrase is a definition of the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent. As for the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared to say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank him for changing the names, at least to this point. And just for my own curiosity I thought I'd look up the "official" definition of large in the dictionary. It reads: large - 1. having more than usual power, capacity, or scope. 2. exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size. Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them. 65 people may be up there, thereby validating definition 2. I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope. Why would he be impressed with this unless it were "large"? I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear yourself speak. I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter. I have very mixed emotions about it. I like the names as they are, and don't think they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be a shred of validity to the change.	10

From his Topps "rookie" year (as coach) card (74-75): "For the past couple of seasons, Don has been the highly-successful coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL, but he is getting his first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins. Named Coach of the Year in the AHL the last two years, and he aims to make the Bruins a rough team again, as they were a couple of years back. Although he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, Don never played a regular-season NHL game. He did appear in one playoff game for Boston in 1956-57. Don's brother, Dick, played two seasons in the NHL with Boston and Philadelphia."	10
I'm familiar with the telethon situation (an individual on CompuServe was also victimized and was equally pissed). That was a local television station contract which could not be broken. For that item, I strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on them. (Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less incentive to pre-empt hockey telecasts in future. The contract was written when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot.)	10
For those of you who read TV Guide, there's an article in next week's SPORTSVIEW concerning the NHL and major network broadcasting. Pretty interesting.	10

No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar. Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM. Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine hadn't jammed. Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there, and that kind of thing can affect the team. Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the right choice was made for that time period.	10
HELP! I'm stuck here at a computer in New Jersey and have no access to a radio or TV. Could someone kindly post the score of the Canucks-Jets game? Thanks in advance.	10
It's called 'contractual obligations' with Major League Baseball. I would've liked to see the OT of the Isles-Caps game, but I understand where ESPN is coming from. ESPN is committed to a single telecast a night and everything after that is a bonus.	10
Does anyone know if MSG will televise any of the Binghampton Rangers playoff games. Even taped replays would be nice?	10

Regardless, they'd have to sparkle from the pressbox. Errey's been out a couple games with a hip injury.	10
Team Canada defeated Russia 3-1 to finish the priliminary round unbeaten at 5-0. Scoring for the Canadians were Kevin Dineen of the Flyers, Eric Lindros also of the Flyers and Paul Cariya of the Maine Black Bears. Cariya has put on quite a show at the Worlds. He is sure to be drafted in the top 3 this summer at the NHL entry draft. Canada defeated Italy 11-2 and Austria 11-0 before meeting the Russians on Sunday. The Canadians now face Finland in the Quarter - finals on Tuesday.	10
Pierre Turgeon of NYI, and Paul Coffey of Detorit are both #77. Hope this help.	10
1993 World Championships in Germany: ==================================== Group A results: SWEDEN - SWITZERLAND 4-6 (0-3,3-1,1-2) 1st: SWI 0-1 Manuele Celio 1 3:21 SWI 0-2 Patrick Howald 1 11:37 SWI 0-3 Patrick Howald 2 (Sven Leuenberger) 16:00 2nd: SWE 1-3 Peter Andersson 1 (Michael Nylander) 2:47 (pp) SWI 1-4 Roman Waeger 1 (Martin Rauch,Sven Leuenberger) 8:53 (pp) SWE 2-4 Jonas Bergqvist 3 (Markus Naslund) 9:08 SWE 3-4 Jan Larsson 1 (Patrik Juhlin) 18:50 3rd: SWE 4-4 Mikael Renberg 2 (Thomas Rundqvist,Peter Andersson) 7:49 SWI 4-5 Roman Waeger 2 9:07 SWI 4-6 Felix Hollenstein 1 (Sven Leuenberger,Thomas Vrabec) 11:29 Shots on goal: Penalties: Attendance: Referee: Sweden 5 20 18 - 43 4*2min 6,000 Rob Hearn, USA Switzerland 10 6 7 - 23 5*2min Switzerland beat Sweden in a WC for the first time since 1950, and the Swiss now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals (if Austria beats Italy tonight). The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest periods I've seen Sweden play this year. Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound. Then a power play goal from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes, Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away, and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom. Switzerland: Goaltender: 20 Reto Pavoni (28 Renatio Tosio) Defense: 26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger 16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch 7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter 31 Samuel Balmer Forwards: 22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger 23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald 35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle 15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - RUSSIA - CANADA 1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0) 1st: CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1 (Garry Galley) 4:28 CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2 (Eric Lindros) 12:20 (pp) 2nd: CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10 (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson) 9:40 RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2 (?) 16:24 3rd: Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic Attendance: 8,600 Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't enough to win against the effective Canadians. Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov. Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score. Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman, then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck. The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner. Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes, and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period. Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game, 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player (among those Kariya with 1+6).

: Detroit's going to beat Toronto in 6 or LESS!!! : : Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux... Just : Look at what Gilmour did for Toronto.

Mario? .. ah... did I mention Mario? If you said Gretzky, you haven't really been following along, have you. If you said Gilmour, you are a true Maynard. I don't even think the selection of the HArt deserves serious discussion on this group. It is a no-brainer.	10
Buffalo fans: Some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator Al" on ESPN, believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres. HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind. As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that. As long as the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at Buffalo. If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying. Game 3 is critical for Boston, not Buffalo.	10
I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).	10
What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk? When I saw what happened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated, since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive. BTW, I believe he picked up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident. To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about the Isles in overtime in the playoffs. Have they *ever* beaten the Islanders in a playoff OT game? This is lunacy. The Caps are such a sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who they should be beating. Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence, it's evidence of the choke factor.	10
ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games. One of the main problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players to be shown between plays. The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile, other times you get burned.	10
I hope this makes you feel better, but the overtime between the Isles and the Caps was GREAT!!!	10
Actually, I was angry when they went away from the Pens game. Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough. I only get to see them on ESPN, and when they play the Caps, cause we're close enough to DC to get all the Caps games, so when ESPN switched to the Caps, . . . AAAGGGHHH!	10
And Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble. The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)	10

OK. I know I look pretty desperate on this bboard. I think I have posted 3 or 4 messages already on the issue of NHL telecats over the last few weeks. But, hey. I am pretty desperate. What I am interested is not just a sportsbar with multiple screens so thast I can watch the game on one of those silent screens. Are there any hockey oriented bars in this area. Or does some Patrick division or Adams division fan have a satellite dish? I don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.	10
what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final and now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !! after the 0:1 against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were overrun 0:6 by the russian team. now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the B-level. does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for the olympic games '94 in Lillehammer or are some teams already qualified for them.	10
Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service. The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.	10
Unfortunately, Roger is now over at r.s.baseball spewing his expertise (i.e. being a dickhead). I guess he is afraid of posting anything here, because he knows what to expect.	10
This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're going to play havoc with the schedule, you should at least make sure that Prime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within one minute or so of the game ending. As for the earlier comments about CBC being "Ontariocentric" frankly the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant see the Leafs and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising for six hours of hockey in one night. As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.	10
Speaking of Roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln? I had him in my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that I've moved to a new news reader which doesn't have kill files, I find that he's gone. I must admit, however, that unlike gln, Roger seems to know something about the game as long as the subject doesn't touch on the Leafs.	10

I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton. Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed to concern the Oiler's future. Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference, Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium. Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier, but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.	10
: That more or less says it. I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw : Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face. I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to : go off on this at all in coach's corner. And that was the ONLY infraction of this type in the game. Come on! Wake up! Geez He's not the only player who does this sort of thing. I think we were kind of lucky. The game was not really all that "chippy" considering the state NJ is in about now.	10
Hi guys.... What happened? 1. Potvin didn't let six goals by. 2. Wendel and Andreychuk woke up. 3. Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs the emotional edge. 4. Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs. A couple of comments: 1. On Gilmour: Just because the guy isn't one of the three stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team. Someone posted the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for accumulating points from the three star selection) during the regular season. 2. On the officiating: I've heard gripes from both ends on this one. Emotions are very high in this series; the rivalry is one of the stronger ones I know of. I do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever missed that slash on Gilmour's hand). 3. In general: I STILL think Detroit has one of the better chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle. D By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not playing aggressive hockey.... By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be. I just like watching a good matchup.	10
I don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey game, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying "sorry we can't show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not even a game. a friggin HIGHLIGHT show). gee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime. I live in Pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot of coverage. i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in Texas must feel.	10
I saw Messier and Leetch shooting at a camera on Letterman(?). I could have been any show though, since I watch NONE of those late night shows very regularly. -John Santore Philadelphia Flyers in '93-'94! ============================================================================= ____________________ / \ "We break the surface tension \_________ ____ \ with our wild kinetic dreams" / / \ \ -Rush, Grand Designs \_______ / (*) ) ) / / /\___/ / Go Philadelphia Flyers! \_____ / / / / / \_______/ John Santore (jsbh@andrew.cmu.edu) \________/	10
: That's not inner calm. It's boredom, and it's being spoiled. The Arena's : been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just : take winning for granted. It's been seemingly forever since the team : lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and : surprise at victory. At least last night there was some excitement. The Pens didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like the previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and played better or if the Penguins just started to play down somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end. They did much more swarming around, which at least kept an element of suspense in the game. No question that Billington helped make it more interesting also. Claude Lemieux didn't help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the game. So, who's going to start in the Devils goal for the "final" game Sunday? ;-) Sorry. I couldn't help myself.	10
Michael J. Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins. While he's not exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident. It was quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew what he was talking about. Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey player is? Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?	10

Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston. Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing). Game winner in OT in game 1, and another BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd. Yes, Neely countered a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series. Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually, they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about. One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon. I'm not gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey. Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE? The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season). The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds. I don't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT. Finally, the Sabres won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times. When Hawerchuck took his shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting it up. I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming, "They score, THEY SCORE!!!". The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on.	10
Gerald, look at what happened to the Stars; they are off to Dallas. Gerald, the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June, unless something RE?ALLY goes wrong this time!! Pocklington could end up being THE embarassment of Klein if he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'. Gerald, people still have an axe to grind with this guy. I CANNOT see him staying for long. But the people in Edmonton won't budge, trust me on this one. Northlands won't budge ccording to one of the board members, Bruce Campbell. I haven't heard anything, BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this year. HINT!!HINT!! Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta? Gerald, don't blame Sather. This battle between the peole and Pocklington started in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky. There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was respectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!! BTW, when following up, please delete name of posting writer.	10
It was a classy move. But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of the coverage to the Pens. On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control. Granted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the Caps and Isles but they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update us on the fifth goal of the rout. Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between the pens and devils. IMHO they should program some variety into the telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.) And what about the Cambell conference? I'd like to see a game in the Norris or Smythe. Why not have back to back nights of National Hockey Night? Just a thought.	10
ESPN had an advertise for Pens/Devils game 4. I don't know what the hell they are trying to do, especially against NFL draft. Well I guess there goes the NHL ratings for Sundays game.	10
yet. I'm not bored either. Most people I know say that winning the second Cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one. But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm to which Susan originally referred. Inner calm is not boredom. As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right. It's been that way all season. I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans. At last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist. Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time. I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out of this series. I doubt that will happen but it's possible. Bored? Uh-uh. Spoiled? Not in the least. Forgot what excitement is like? Living through that amazing streak wasn't exciting?! I don't take a darned thing for granted. God, look at Chicago... And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway. It isn't gonna last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.	10
Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display by MacLean. The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that they were mailing them. BTW, Greg...next time, don't fall asleep in geography class, it's pretty sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in North America can't. One more thing...how LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL? How many championships do they have? Oh yeah...and I CAN go to the Arena and see not one, not two, but *six* championship banners hanging from the rafters. 3 Stanley Cup banners, and 3 Avco Cup banners. My NHL guide says that Vancouver has won the Cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of Kenora has won it!)	10
Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them. Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids that do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter. I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's just an asshole.	10
While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the "slash" that Barrasso took on the neck. This brought to mind the goaltender who had his jugular vein cut by a skate. I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive. Does anyone remember/know his name? What has happened to him since? What about the player whose skate cut the goalie? Name? Info? Has this ever happened before in a hockey game? Thanks,	10

Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit following the 1989-90 season. This was during the off-season though. There's countless examples of captains being traded, I'm sure.	10

It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate. I know it happened in Buffalo, but I can't tell you against whom. Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net. Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. He's been playing in San Diego for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley. Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade. What do I win? =)	10
If ESPN pisses you off, call them - they do respond to calls. Last night I called when they said they were cutting to baseball and we couldn't see the sudden-death overtime for the BUffalo game. Apparently they received enough calls so they waited for the overtime to finish before cutting away. Their phone number is 203-585-2000	10
I watched the game Germany-Czechs in WC today...and i was astonished about the behaviour of the German audience! The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went grazy! They threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is that stupid or what?? I guess the Canadian referee (one of the Isostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't help much. I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone- But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude in every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer) It really pisses me off! I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but most of them seem to do...	10
"They're real and they're spectacular", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in consecutive playoff games. If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice in the last seconds of the game. "Not that there's anything wrong with that." Curtis Joseph has been the "master of his own domain", and the Hawks have been shooting the puck like a bunch of "chuckers". Not even "Superman" could play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his "cereal." "It's like a sauna in here" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and the wild crowd at the Arena. It was "very refreshing" to see the Blues "double-dip" the Hawks. The Hawks goons tried to "pick" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues checking line "nipped" those Hawks real well. The fat "Yoyoma" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the "beach". The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long "journey from Milan to Minsk" Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple. Just a little fun.	10
That's not inner calm. It's boredom, and it's being spoiled. The Arena's been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just take winning for granted. It's been seemingly forever since the team lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and surprise at victory. While I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago, and the Rangers last year. Too much of a good thing is not always good for you.	10
Nah, Cherry will only spew if Ulf was nailing "a good Canadian boy". What an idiot... if this is the heart and soul of Canadian patriotism, then someone needs a new hobby...	10
Good point - there haven't even been any recent posts about Ulf! Secretly, I'm convinced that he's responsible for the Bs being down 3-0 to Buffalo, somehow.	10
That was Clint Malarchuk. That was a very dangerous accident. He could he died right there on the ice. However, he has played since but I don't know where he is now. I think he is still playing but I'm not positive. He was a Sabre at the time. I don't know who skated into him though. I remember a couple of seasons before the Malarchuk incident Borje Salming of Toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into his face. That took a lot of stiches to fix.	10
Isn't he the guy who took shots at Jagr and Ulf in a recent Sports Illustrated? I'm not familiar with Cherry's work, and maybe he's known for sarcasm, but I'd have to wonder about him doing commentary for the Pens.	10
Only problem is that Zombo was traded to St. Louis last year for goalie Vincent Riendeau. I think that while Chevy is not among the elite class of goalies, he is adequate given the offensive firepower of the Wings.	10
so all us hockey/automobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand ESPN delays the martinsville race by a day for the NFL draft ESPN shows baseball instead of the overtime of a NHL playoff game gimme a break, guys => >>Does anyone know why this race is tape delay?

As I recall they've been doing this => ever since they started covering the draft live. I wish they could work => out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as TNN to get the race => on live, but I guess ESPN isn't much into sharing. It also clarifies => where auto racing stands on their priority list (as if we didn't already => know ;-) --	10
Grant Fuhr has done this to a lot better coaches than Brian Sutter...	10
My sig has nothing to do with cockiness. What you put in your sig has nothing to do with your article, as I learned back in the fall, the hard way. You mean 'butt' don't you? Not but :-) Sure you do -- what?????????? Two points, one what does r.s.b.c. have to do with hockey? Secondly, UMASS beat my Quakers??? Hello!!! Earth here, are you responding??? We're not in the Atlantic 10 (or 8 whatever you wanna call it), we're in the Big 10 now!!! The A-10 was too weak for my Lady Lions -- they had to go to a more challenging conference. It didn't pay off as the Big East showed them a thing or too, but I still posted on a regular basis and tracked all the women's scores with reviews throughout the tournament. It wasn't a reason to stop posting. :-) It's not over yet -- if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games, I think Boston can do it, but I still see Buffalo winning in 6. Agreed -- they're playing tremendous hockey right now. Congatualtions on three straight Buffalo. It could very easily be 2-1 Boston, but Buffalo has come up tough and a little luck. (You never see a penalty in OT that doesn't have both sides involved in a playoff game. Never never never!)	10
Hey, we could start a new game on the net. It's called 'Where's Roger?' It's similiar to 'Where's Waldo?' but instead of finding Waldo in a picture of people, we try to find Roger in a newsgroup on the net. I predict that he'll be in r.s.basketball.pro next.	10
[stuff deleted] The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the playoffs. While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively, embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the Norris). It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*-- tougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division. Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota. Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis). Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division. They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris. Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent. For really good players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it. (And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans. The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team. Then, even his coaching began to degrade. There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman. And one player cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone reading this will agree. We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out, like last year).	10
According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest on the Treasury Branch loans. That's a lot of green. Again, according to TSN, virtually everything that Peter Puck has already has liens against it. Of course we can't really be sure of this. The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal. Sather has spouted this repeatedly. Pocklinton has a contract with Northlands until 1999. A deal is a deal. Perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he wouldn't be losing money. He has admitted pulling this money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses. I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization. I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but he is certainly not entitled to it. Pocklington has "sucked" revenue out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests. Pocklington is not to be trusted. I doubt very much that any Oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship. As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks. --	10
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993. The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) Topics ------ Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter. Episode Summary --------------- This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.) Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr. Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the "greatest goalie", and said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself. He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised "Don't Trade Fuhr!" Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated. The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty. Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved, but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: "Its sad what they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed." Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto. People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke "Wendy" for not fighting. However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either. This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking: "It's like college hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody. That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made by people who don't know what's going on in hockey". The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was taught to "play to win", which differs from today's idea of just letting kids have fun. At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some good quotes.

I can't believe sh*t like this gets any attention in this group during the playoffs. Ali,you're a blabbering moron. At least you could've waited 'till the end of the playoffs to start your dumb letter campaign.	10

How did the Leafs turn it around??? I couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA. Did the Leaf defense wise up overnight? Did the Leafs get in the slot or was it just "fluke" goals in a goalie duel? Did the Wings turn off the jets or muscle? What gives here? I caught game 1 on satellite. I figured my Leafs were washed. This is a _major_ turnaround. Very few predicted this. How, how, how did it happen? Wing and Leaf perspectives welcomed!	10
The top 11 teams of this tournament will play in the Olympics next year. The last team of this tournament, top two of pool B (Great Britain and Poland) and the winner of pool C (Latvia) will play for the last Olympic spot next fall. However, if next year's hosts Norway were to finish 12th (which would be no surprise), then it's the 11th team of pool A that will have to play in the qualification tournament.	10
The goalie to whom you refer is Clint Malarchuk. He was at that time playing with the Sabres. His team immediately prior to that was the Washington Capitals. While he did recover and continue to play, I do not know his present whereabouts.	10
Gaetz won't be back. There's been rumors he was officially released right at the end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he wasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this spring, doesn't make sense.	10

On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes Fereirra made. Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of hindsight. Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra. I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view: they should have kept him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey! (Wonder what sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax? (His job, I guess.)) have fun gak	10
Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list: In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's 1st round upset of the Providence Bruins came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL. Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that: "...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester media, openly cheering for Springfield." Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership. BTW- This was posted with the permission of Chris	10
My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the first period and the Leafs none. As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings. Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then calling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away from what could have been a great game.	10
Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games. The statstical odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50. Two straight games -- 25%. Three straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%. The odds of the Penguins winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%. Of course, this doesn't include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made the act balanced out. That's about right. For Boston the odds of winning are probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as good and Boston has a stronger team. Enough about my QBA probabilities though! It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie Gibson :-) Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me. I give Blue 4 starts. Fuhr has been too tough. Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10. It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something. Actually it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game. But when the competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about who wins or loses :-) I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away. They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1. Good point here. Chicago's in deep trouble tonight. The 'Hawks have a bad past history of winning the division and losing early. When they don't finish 1st, they do okay.	10
On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided bonus hockey coverage. Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game. People must realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the U.S The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so they can't skip the baseball game. Why don't you people CHILL OUT and enjoy whatever coverage you can get.	10
Have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed in between periods on a tv game. That they usually get a goal or an assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk to stars more than regular players which explains the hight percentage of results after. Just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont care about this trivial nonsense. ttyl Tom	10
Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins? I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the series. If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over. It will be hello next year. The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by the Bruins. He has shown demonstrated excellent speed. Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.	10
Hey,guess what's coming to ESPN for a change? A playoff which doesn't involve the Pens. Not that there is anything wrong with that... ESPN games : Thursday Game3 Pens at Devils at 7:30(Gary Thorne and Bill Clement) Saturday Game4 Caps at NY Isles at 7:30(Tom Mees and John Davidson) ABC game : Sunday Game4 Pens at Devils at 1:00 (Gary Thorne and Bill Clement) ESPN named its #2 broadcast team on Tuesday. It paired Tom Mees(play by play) with John Davidson(analyst).	10
The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not covered 'til the final horn sounds. With two channels, SCNY and SCA, late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will kick in at the end of local coverage. If SCNY is blocked by the Mets, there is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus). With an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated. gld	10

They _finally_ started going to the net! See what happens when you create some traffic? Muller deserves full marks (what a player!), and Damphousse finally started skating. Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou) was excellent. Did you see that third period save on Young? And the defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone. Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds out that the winning goal went in off his own D-man's skate? Whatta suck. Although he _is_ playing really well. Sure it does. On Sunday when the B's are golfing and the Habs are tied 2-2 you'll see what I mean! :-) :-)	10
Charles Hubbert writes... Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter. However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up big when it counts. The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned was scored. In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming back, Chevy was exceptional. I can see him as a Barraso style playoff goalie: inconsistant when there's nothing on the line, but comes up big when really needed. I guess we'll both find out. Ron	10
It was unlikely, improbable. For the Bruins, it was the stuff of nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven. For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three games of a series. Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens. It takes a little more work this time. The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work. On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win. It wasn't easy. It wasn't always pretty. It still worked. John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender. Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday. Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box. LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists. Goal number two was Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev. Smehlik and Hannan assisted. Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box. Period two was scoreless, a split of penalties between the two clubs. The third saw Boston's Smolinski get his first, courtesy of Oates. Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney). Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime. Last year overtime meant a Bruin win. Last night, it spelled sweet revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime. Both teams finished with 34 shots. Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2. Referee--Rob Shick. Comments: Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing. Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic again. Mogilny was checking. Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny. The crowd was unbelievable. I don't think I've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was only five when they played for the cup. I don't remember it and no one took me to the games). Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview, noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was too loud, even though he was shouting. It didn't seem to matter, as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great. Yuri Khmylev didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called. Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey. When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress). The interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he must not understand playoffs. Uh-huh.	10

During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens. Jagr, MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch. But, one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman. Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark. Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done. His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible. Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis. Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance. As a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night. His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about success.	10

Whoa there! Lighten up, Andrew! When I was referring to "you dorks at the Western Business School", I was specifically referring to those assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of Minnesota for no apparent reason. Being Canadian, and one who has friends who attended UWO, I personally don't want to be associated with the idiots who wrote those messages. One more thing, Andrew...until this season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen years (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars haven't been the only "shit" team in the Norris.	10
First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job, but last night I felt the same way. I really hate watching Devils/Pens game. Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even bother showing them. I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract. I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting. Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast we can get diffrent hockey games.	10
Hey man! - Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a couple of sessions of mock hockey, I'm ready to invest in hockey equipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey lessons'). However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it comes to hockey equipment. I've checked out local stores and looked at catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before actually plunking down any money. Having played football in high school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for comparison. But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles? Are there any notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles? etc. So any suggestions or comments would be greatly appreciated.	10
Considering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coach's Corner on Hockey Night in Canada, it would surprise me as well. But then, people will do anything for money, won't they?	10

Yeah... I think that the Flames and the Flyers traded Captains once... Mel Bridgeman for Brad Marsh.	10
Why would Pollin want to move the Caps, because I think he owns the Cap Centre. I know they don't sell out all of their games, but they draw a lot more than the Bullets. If you had the situation that Abe had, would you move if you were guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to park at the stadium, because there has been nothing within a half mile, until the recent construction in the area. Can they win a game in OT again. Rich	10
So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN, and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a game on MSG. What are you complaining about? I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage. I even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of hockey. And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other games because its feature game was over? Sound familiar? This year I'm getting twice the coverage. I can see all the Caps games *plus* the games ESPN shows. I think it's great that hockey is back on ESPN. IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering the baseball contract they have to work around. --	10

Bleep! Bleep! Bleep! The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T. I can't stand it! Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense. Boston players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions. The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds. Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he's also getting plenty of help. Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game. As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down. This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite bleak). IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first. If they can do that, they have an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods. (The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year. I'll never cheer for the Sabres... You can't convert me... ^:) MTM3	10
The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain to them directly. Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct? I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply change the channel from a boring game....I know I did. And then, when they didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid! If I wanted to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed. My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!	10
Well, so are we, and we see it completely different than you. Guess it's a matter of perspective.	10
ST> as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton ST> catain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to ST> the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky ST> who w traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who ST> nly this year was traded to the N Y Rangers Wasn't Mark Messier Captain of the oilers before Kevin Lowe?

I'm glad Grant Fuhr will never be as over-confident after two wins as you are...it takes four wins to defeat an opponent...each tougher to obtain than the previous one. Buffalo is off to a good start... Fuhr is proving the Fuhr-bashers wrong, but Boston is an awfully good team.	10

This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves us Caps fans a lot of pain. I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times have they done that in their history? 1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight 1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being 1) a sweep of Philly in 1984 2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME they managed to get out of the division. Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples: 1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1, gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the last minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot. Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later. 2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games. 3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period. Blew it and the series. 4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it. 5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period. Blew it again. When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: "if they blew this lead, the series is OVER". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders believe they can come back no matter what the score is. I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear lives in a crucial game. Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking "wait until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire". Well, they retired (even though Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess it has nothing to do with the players.	10
The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!! John Scialdone SCIALDONE@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV	10
The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2. The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the numbers that counted: goals. Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals. However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second, checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1. Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays. Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably. McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead. A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2. The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off. This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported. However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance. By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2. Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games. - 30 -	10

Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke? I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting. Not that Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0 pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils. You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).	10
Hey American Hockey fans, As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel. The problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey. They view it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally. On the other hand BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "NATIONAL PASTTIME". BASEBALL is so romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport exist after April 1 and before November 1. I feel that since ESPN shows 5+ BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game. Hell, the game is going to last 2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs? And I am an Indians fan! Show the end of what you started, then switch! But then, I'm a hockey fan, what do I know? BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.	10
I'd like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team NHL. So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes. Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced "European" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I stand by all the misstatements that I've made. -- Vice President Dan Quayle to Sam Donaldson, 8/17/89	10

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game" for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans were starting to come up strong. I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events. If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example). But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all) Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries...).

I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first "modern" coach. Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room in the 70s. He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates the press into spreading false game plan rumours. (During important games listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to what is on the ice!) I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free in OT. When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach! I am left asking "What is a modern coach if not Bowman?"	10
Yeah, it's the second one. And I believe that price too. I've been trying to get a good look at it on the Bruin-Sabre telecasts, and wow! does it ever look good. Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing. And given Fuhr's play since he got it, I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it:)	10
Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight, so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots are at a disadvantage in the new system. Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't like it, but that's the way the league is going.	10

Them thar's fighting words...hardly a force...geez...miss the playoffs once in 15 years, and even after making the final four 3 times in the last five years, and everyone thinks its doomsville. Fedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake, Kennedy, Racine, and Cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to Devellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman, Probert, Carson, Chiasson, etc. No...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to take advantage of all of Devellano's good drafting...if Devellano had not given in to Demers request to make the Oates trade, he might still be GM.	10

Actually it was in the third period, his return did bring a spark to the crowd, and to the players, who played awesome defense in the third. You forgot about Gretzky. If any of these guys start scoring, the Kings will be unstoppable, if they continue the great defensive work as well. Stauber will be in net on Tuesday. Hopefully he will provide another stellar performance and earn the name Robb "Stopper" Stauber. I believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he has been putting a number of people on left. Also the Carson, Robataille Kurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines. (Hopefully!) It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight breakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion might help him break his streak. Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few really good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide. Is the injury still affecting him? The E D G E	10
Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out, since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it. I assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory (MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being a solid seven hours plus from Long Island. Does anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13? Did Empire demand a fortune for the games? What about the games on Fox37 (or whatever number it is there in Buffalo)? Has anyone phoned to complain (besides me)? George	10
OK, here is my try: Lukko, Finland (look at the colors of his mask) ex-JyPHT, Finland, now in Germany Excellent defenseman HIFK, Finland Tappara, Finland HPK, Finland Jokerit, Finland HPK, Finland JyPHT, Finland, no new contract JyPHT owns his player rights All of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey players. It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal. "Dole" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make a new contract. The other Czech we had, Jiri Jonak, got fired also.	10
This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio for ESPN hockey. The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game (even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game going to overtime. When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said he heard many people say f**K .!#$%. ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT broadcast the OT of the hockey game. Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey. GET OFF ESPN'S BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT!!! There have been to many f****n complainers about this game that it's making me sick.	10
Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides Pilon??? Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the blueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there must be someone else!!!

So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds on him? If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin in return? This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with his stick. Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles isn't? How do the refs know what to call? Do the goalies get more liberties than other players?	10
John Girash writes... You can get WJR a LONG way away. The problem is that, because of those well known and beloved "contractual obligations", WJR will be doing Tiger baseball instead of the Wings playoff games for probably half the games the Wings could play.

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis Joseph. When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do. Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled. As for the game on Sunday. The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt. One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to give them penalties. Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear. No linesman, no shot for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect. On another of St. Louis' goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player. Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease. No goalie, no way to stop the shot. I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks. It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack. ____________________________________________________________________________	10
News: ===== For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not a major part of the team. Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. Thoughts on Game 1: ================== The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. Thoughts on Game 2: ================== The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice. The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed 30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet. The only difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come from the one with David Koresh. Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties, but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team an advantage? I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year, whereas many others did. Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about being hit. He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting them up.) Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life?	10

I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose games are regularly broadcast on an FM station. The only one I am aware of is WYSP in Philadelphia who carries the Eagles' games. If you respond to me I will summarize for the list.	10
I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that! While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres. In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was) through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game). There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the victory. In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev (compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense , IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall ;-) The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16, they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate. I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs. She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She then couldn't give me a coherent answer. Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with thier sports programming. I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.	10

Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to let SportsChannel pick up the slack. Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S. Support your team; support your game. Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and that you won't consider buying their products because of it.	10

I have some advice for you, and some thoughts about your hatred of the Minnesota North Stars: 1. A real team like Toronto would not be moved, you are right, just eliminated from the playoffs first round! 2. Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in Western Ontario and actually take classes on map-reading and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you. 3. Why should anyone love the Stars, when hating the Leafs is so much better? 4. Oh, I'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my big words.. next time I'll limit my vocabulary to words like "get real team now" and "do not waste our time" 5. Respond to this article.

Exactly my point. If you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot of goons going after him. Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical players for Pgh are left alone. Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr. If you want to say anyone on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield. Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens even when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties. Hey, that's fine! If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized including Ulf. Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter. It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon, because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.	10
No, Fuhr's 5 rings out sparkle Errey's. And doesn't Bob have 2 rings?	10
Borchevsky is 5'9" and Gilmour is 5'11"...I think Gilmour slightly outweighs Borchevsky. Andreychuk is also about 5'11", I think.	10
I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the Vezina. I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates this year. I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin receive for their goaltending. I do think that they are great in the nets, but I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years playoffs. The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front of them and the goaltenders get the most credit. I would rather face 25 shots a game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to face 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them. -Jay ps Go Quebec!!! And I know that McLean and several others should be mentioned as candidates for this years Vezina, but I am partial to Joseph and Barrasso this season.	10
The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think in terms of who was the "best" player, rather in terms of who was the most valuable to the team. And "valuable to his team" was not, and should not be, considered synonymous with "best". We are talking about a time when honour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets a player brought to his team, his league and his sport. This was before the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory. The Hart Trophy is not a prize. It is an honour. --	10

Det st|rsta felet med }rets indelning {r *exakt* samma som f|rra }ret, fast v{rre. DET [R INTE R[TVIST INDELAT, sportligt sett. Vallentuna var en match fr}n att g} upp till Allsvenskan f|rra }ret ist{llet gick G{vle upp. Tror ni n}n av dem lyckas lika bra i }r? AIK, HIF, SSK och HIK ska sl}ss om tv} platser!! Om man hadde placerat dessa i var sin division skulle de vara sj{lvklara favoriter till en plats i Allsvenskan, men nu m}ste tv} ge vika. Var finns r{ttvisan i det? :-( Jag har h|rt att HIK har l{mnat in en protest till f|rbundet ang{ende indelningen i |stra. Mitt f|rslag vore att l}ta 3:orna i varje division kvalspela om tv} platser i Allsvenskan och efter jul skulle man kunna sl} ihop de fyra divisionerna till tv}, en s|der och en norr. P} s} s{tt bestraffas inte ett lag som kommer fr}n en trakt d}r det finns m{nga bra lag. En kul grej som jag |nskar att man inf|rde {r att l}ta vinnaren i Allsvenskan f} spela i SM-slutspelet. Det skulle bli en extra krydda till division ett ishockeyn om lagen k{nde att de var "inom r{ckh}ll" till SM-bucklan.

Okay... here's some gripe"ing" (?griping?... whatever). (I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think) Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN. ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the Red Wings/Toronto game... cool. But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday. I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday. OVERNIGHT they changed their mind. I didn't mind THAT MUCH. I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better than NO hockey). During the game their were no video highlights from the Patrick division. What the hell was going on? At least they should show video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was so close). My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt]) got to watch the Pens game on ESPN. I just don't get it. The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game 3. At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game. If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as hell. Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR SOMETHING. Matt Coohill	10

I don't "notice" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and yes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I've seen so far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game). What's the scoop on this guy? Is he the latest incarnation of KERRY FRASER??? Just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesn't make you a good ref!!! Making the right call does... My votes for: Best Ref: Van Hellemond Most Improved: Koharski Worst: Paul Stewart (Oops, I don't really want to start a best/worst ref thread so don't follow up ;-)	10
Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger, but actually a truly held opinion. Thanks. For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important enough to say something themselves. I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of a group that you belong to. It represents a subset (that you don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this isn't a moderated group). Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint. Three that come to mind are as follows: 1) Say it subtly. Result: it may not be clear. 2) Say it directly yet politely. Result: probably it will spark some interesting conversation. 3) Say it directly and obnoxiously. Result: validity goes right out the window. You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be used against you.	10

I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually, I am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final regular season game. PENS RULE!!!	10
Don't let this confuse anybody. The Winnipeg Jets have never won the Stanley Cup (or even come that close). These Stanley Cup championships go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century. The Winnipeg Victorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of them. Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn of the century?? Lets face facts. The Canucks are leading the series 3-1. The Canucks dominated the Jets in their season series. The Canucks did better in the regular season than Winnipeg. Who is the better team? I think that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg.	10
much Pure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money. He has been awesome in the playoffs, especially last night. But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian friend Kymlev (sp?) has also done well. But Fuhr is the biggest reason they are winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.	10
It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus. Have simply been too damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained. You can be sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if the Leafs give just cause. And let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the subject headers. I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form of notoriety. One thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 games. --	10

Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was quite much similar to the first game Finland played (against France). The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so. The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.	10
Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England states. This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened 28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay tuned.	10
(Susan Clark) asks: I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje, who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL (initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl Turner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two years ago now. Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL. Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years. He wrote a book on his experiences called "Behind the Red Line" (check it out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them. -- Mike	10

Rob Niedermayer is a forward (center, I think) with the WHL Medicine Hat Tigers. His brother, Scott, is a defenseman (now with the NJ Devils).	10
Yes, he does. BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there! When I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot. I don't care if he's in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball! (Yes, roller hockey, remember) And if there was nobody around to clear the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does too. I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people out of the way. He's a player on the ice too, you know. :-)	10
Don't know who scored, but the Isles (28-7 franchise record in playoff OT games) took game four by a score of 4-3 for their third consecutive OT win over the Capitals tonight at Uniondale. If you know, please post who scored for a Isles fan living in Atlanta:Hockey Hell. Lord Stan's a Uniondale Man! GO ISLES!	10
Two years ago Mark Messier appeared on David Letterman the summer he signed wit h the Rangers. I remember he and Mike Gartner taking slapshots at the camera, one finally was a bullseye and the screen went blank. It was funny if you saw it, I guess.	10
Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he could be a key to success for them this year. Defensively, they really had a strong game. Hardly heard Selanne's name all night. Craven also played one of his best games since coming over. With a few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much high-flying. I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to make this a series. In short, it was a great start!	10
As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem with violence in the sport of hockey. How the hell can you say the guy is a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality? Saying that hurting a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine. New rules and a new referee system need to be instituted. Right now, too many of the real goons get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the play. Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an improvement.	10
As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and Andersson to report to Binghampton. It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger organization, however. Is having Binghampton win the Calder Cup really more important to them than keeping their players happy?	10
Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners. When/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes through, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV contract). The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the Prism pay channel. There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's, another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements. With all this cross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this season!! gld	10

(Ali's letter deleted for brevity) Roger, Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions, then. You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like wheat at harvest-time. She never said she represented the entire internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey. She has every right to state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or hundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on the bottom of it. You may not agree with it. Fine. I really don't care enough about the name change to care. Your name isn't attached to it, so why moan and complain? If you felt her words were leading, well, you're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never hurt. I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine (I have the right to think and say that, too). Ali's under no compunction to change a single word. Now, while you're free to disagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is uncalled for. I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand. If you tear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastised publicly in return. Would it have been so hard to say, "Ali, please be a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read it indicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true. I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite your intent to list names at the bottom. Thanks. Cordially as always," &c. Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of myself, and possibly others. Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if it's not something I personally advocate. :-)	10
An interesting note ... I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team. I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and then never touched the roster again. I got wrapped up in my own "money" pool and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew btw). The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and maybe John MacLean. Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well. Out of curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to finsh 79th! I'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me :) Ciao. Brad Gibson -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Brad K.

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view. I don't like to see stickwork, but you have to clear players away from in front. My personal favorite move (I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref isn't looking. Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot). It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty. Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short side. Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with helpful diagrams, of course). It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays huge!) fall on his back a few times! :-)	10
Nothing wrong with what Felix did. The only problem was that he didn't Dino hard enough. Next time Felix aim for the ankles!!!!!!!!!!	10
WATCH OUT PITSBURGH HERE COME THE ISLES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They said we wouldn't make the playoffs and we came in third They said the Caps would beat us and they're not going to They say that Pitsburgh has a 1:1 ratio of winning the cup but We'll prove them wrong. L E T S G O I S L A N D E R S!!!!!!! Bring it back home	10
YAHOOOOOOOOO! The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec City to play game 5. BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2. The score might be a bit misleading. The Habs dominated the game from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on. The score should have been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall (bastard!). He's the reason the score was as close. Habs winning goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd. Roy had an OK game. He made the first save (one way or another) and the defense was there to clear any rebounds. This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT. YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Those suckers got what they deserved. Life is just great!!!! Now if my finals would go just as well! Nick (I'll take off my town crier hat now)	10
: Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight, : so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when : the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players : stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots : are at a disadvantage in the new system. : Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective : method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of : causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't : like it, but that's the way the league is going. : By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil : game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a : legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do : things like that.) Are there any ex NHL hockey players out there who might care to comment on this and end this ridiculously long discussion?	10
Lori, the regular Penguins poster here on rec.sport.hockey, indicated to me via e-mail that on the nights that Pirates baseball and Penguins playoff games coincide, the Pens will be covered on WDVE FM (102.5).	10
While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion, but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs.	10

Okay, the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they do, does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals' futility record in the playoffs? I remember that Terry's first year was the first year that the Caps finally made it to the third round but before under Brian, I noticed that every other year the Caps got to the second round and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. Is this trend continuning? The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan. P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh! ____________________________________________________________________________ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~	10
Don't expect to get top quality, just some toughness. I don't view Makarov as a player who would add toughness. Nelson, you're confusing skill and toughness. Hey, get off the McGill/Hammond thing. I'm no fan of either. My point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing this year. This year we had more skill, I'm all for that, but if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they can't do you much good. Whether it's a cheap shot or not you can't let the other teams push you around. The 1992-93 Sharks simply got pushed around to much. Other teams knew this. They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not pay for it. Adding some players in the off season who will add some toughness to the team will help insure that next season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously check our skill players, or to take cheap shots. It doesn't guarantee no injuries (nothing does), but it's something the Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries. mark just say	10
Looks like Bob Errey's ring really sparkles in that locker room, and everyone else wants one, too! :-) Correct me if I'm wrong though, (just through the net, not through e-mail, I don't need 100 rl's in my e-mail!) but wasn't Boston down 2-0 vs. Buffalo last year?Boston lost 1 and 2 at home and won 3 and 4 in Buffalo. Whoever wins game 3 will advance. Simple as that!!! :-)	10
Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, "Hey, let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. It's entirely another to say, "Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town and move it!" Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000 level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets thing as an excuse. I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond me. I only hope they get a new team soon. Just my $0.02. -- Ali.	10
Heh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain. I'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into the Long Beach GP. =) Were you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day "contracts" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST show that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to have their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business, not your own personal video servant. Maybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to Dodge saying that "thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS, you will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time for hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry games (just one example) Come on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the "big three" overight.	10
Where is Roger anyway? Haven't heard from him in awhile. He must be out on the golf course waiting for the Leafs to join him any day now. : )	10

I too am of the same sentiment Bart, but realistically, this town DOESN'T WANT TO pay for quality player and hence we are loosing these people left, right and center. Labour is also responsible for their boycott Pocklington movement. I would like the Oilers to stay, but realistically, given this situation, it's bye-bye Oilers.	10
Lots of debate about the virtues of Bryan Murray vs Pat Quinn as a GM deleted. Randy Graca seems to think Murray is the best GM in the league. I think Quinn is one of several who are better. When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they regularily missed the playoffs. I can't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did. Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender. When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender. So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM. Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.	10
He's a Canadian "thing". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado Rockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef this year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S. and European programs. After he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada and hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least on playoff season after the Rockies were eliminated. I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest thing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described hockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get people upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler doesn't. Don's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial he wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass. But then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that I wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).	10
You must be kidding, right? In losing Stevens the Blues got Shanahan and kept Joseph. Then they traded Oates for Janney. As a Hawks fan you have got to respect those "hapless" names. 8^) Lets see, who scored the game winning overtime goal in the 4th game???	10
The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules. Overtime time games that are not shown? What the hell kind of shit is this? If that would have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof! However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the ones to blame. They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break whenever they want to. The N.H.L. is to blame. When they signed the deal with ESPN, they had to know of this. They had to know shit like this would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority. The N.H.L. should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN. How can the N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they. We are the ones that make the damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to watch! They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get. We must let the N.H.L. know that we expect a little better than this. If anybody out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know. Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it.... Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey. All that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2. Last night in the 3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off. The guy on him was doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for holding. They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him. It is simple, Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2. But the thing that really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember, on the resulting PP and eventually won 4-3. His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the outcome of a game. They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious. That is not hockey. It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones. This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat. However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got any. All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.	10

This would be dumb move of the nineties...Lindros is big and strong... but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the other to drag along. Not if Pocklington gets there first! (-...actually, if Pocklington doesn't get a better deal, he would probably go to Hamilton...taking the team out of Canada would get the whole country mad at him... taking the team to Hamilton wouldn't get anybody mad at him that isn't mad at him already...and would make him a lot of friends in Southern Ontario...so many that the whining of the stupid politicians in Edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldn't be noticed at all. Edmonton would wallow in anonymnity.	10

I wonder how many more years it will take Gretz to beat this one? ;-)	10
Teemu Selanne had 3 goals, Keith Tkachuk had one, and Luciano Borsato scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the Canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1. Trevor Linden and Pavel Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause. Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon. Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed last year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again. I'll have to be quietly happy with a solid performance. ;)	10
Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years that he has owned the team. When he bought the team, it seemed kind of obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red, before the team started making a profit again. He gave the impression that he was willing to do so. He claimed two years ago that the team needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit, but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket prices. I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in deciding to move. He was even offered the many concessions he rudely demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the other two arenas in town, etc. Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$. Green wanted immediate huge returns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel Minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down there as well. All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team for a year or two. Too bad for the NHL.	10

Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net, that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However, there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I was very disappointed. You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but intentional) use of the stick.	10
M(--> were doomed to 4'th in the division. I'm still not convinced the M(--> Sabres will win this series (I've lived in Buffalo all my life, and M(--> these last 10 years have been playoff Hell), but I'm just sitting M(--> back, crossing my fingers and hoping the offense can keep scoring Have no fear, Doug, the Bruins are toast. Statistically, only 2 teams in **all** the Stanley Cup series ever played have come back to win. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer team, with all the crowing from Boston fans I've had to endure over the last month. Take heart, Bruins fans. At least you finished first in the Adams <sinister chuckle>. - Jack * Laugh and the world thinks you're an idiot.	10
Well, the "jettison for youth fast" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it didn't work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the Sharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It was the injuries that caused us to fall. From all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw". There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed). I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now a moot point). The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There were conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. I think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as a "Shark person". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in Anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey. (but I want the Ducks to be doormats for a couple of years, so the Sharks succeeed first).	10
Oh really? I seem to remember this year's woofers consisting mainly of yourself and Roger. Boston fans were relatively quiet. I guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you couldn't possible understand, eh? Nah. I doubt you really would. You're just being a PROVOCATIVE SOB as usual with a large stick up your but. Of course, I mean that in the nicest way. :-) And just how much bragging did YOU do, "wobbie," on r.s.b.c after UMASS!!! beat your Quakers? BTW. Congratulations should go to the Sabres. They are playing more diciplined, and with more will to win. They deserve it.	10
Could someone please tell me how I can access the FAQ for this group? I'm relatively new, and would like to read it, but although I've seen it mentioned, I've yet to see it posted.

Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players.... you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their teams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular season. I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read this item.....gee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the playoffs. Kind of makes you wonder....... Bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the WartHawks!!!!! Agreed Jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far. About the only thing that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fans....Detroit has completely kicked their asses so far. But, I will stick with the Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.	10
Yeh,but : 1.Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.L wasn't very impressive. His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs. It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins. 2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their entire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on his head. Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend. Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after an incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major leagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins' flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about 15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics and about 5% are on the Bruins. Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding early.	10
that his positive. Clint Malarchuk What has happened to him since? Assigned to San Diego Gulls at the being of the season I believe What It was Uwe Krupp and a Blues player, though Uwe's skate I beleive cut Clint. He has since be traded to the Isles in the LaFontaine deal. Has this ever This is the only time I know of.	10

Well that's really great Pat. I guess since you've played a little you thereby qualify as an expert. Especially since you watch all the games on t.v. All that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato Pat Walker	10
Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad?? I can't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being fired on goal. In fact, I think they even missed one goal completely because they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner. Now the last time I watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . . Is it just me??	10
Not boring is right!!! It is more likely to cause me to have a stroke!! I had to listen to game two on the Blackhawk station and I don't think I could take another call of "And JOSEPH makes a SPEcTACular saaaaaave". Now I'm a Blues fan, but I don't want them to play "like" they played in game two. Sure the result was fine, but the Blues match up very well with the Hawks so they really don't need to treat them like the 86 Flames. We don't need a "Monday Night Miracle" to have a chance to beat Chicago. The Blues can do it on talent. At least over the hawks. Rich h.--- Go BLUES!!	10
WHY!!! DC/Baltimore is one of the top media markets (=the only thing the NHL seems to care about these days), they've been doing far better than the NBA Bullets at the gate for the last five years. The team has been a perennial contender and fan support has been good to excellent . . . Why should Pollin move to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro sports. I don't get it...	10
The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec defender who deflected the puck. The re-play officials did not take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first non-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial. I agree that it was a great game; good to see Roy and Damphousse back into form. Hopefully the sign of good things to come...	10
Ok, Buffalo fans. I am a Red Wings fan, but am amazed at how the Sabres are beating up on the Bruins. Is there any reason for this? Is it Grant Fuhr or Mogilny and Lafontaine? I would like to hear from you since I do not know much about the Sabres.	10
Sabres are Fuhr or know much Two words: Grant Fuhr.	10
Wood is fairly small for an enforcer-type. I mean, Fleury does a pretty good job and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or skate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad, but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth talking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times. Unless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my "career minor leaguer" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He needs to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some versatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't particularly good as a goon.	10

(Detroit, April 21) Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to another easy victory over the best team in the NHL. For the best goaltender in the world, Felix Potvin, six was a bad number as he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team.

For those of you who complain about Don Cherry, and wonder why he is popular... the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell. John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has lost his marbles. Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or that college with outrageous statements. Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey? Canadians are very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey and curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball and bowling.	10
I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma). I'm hoping I can get a reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas. I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly, THE hockey state in the U.S. So why is the team moving to a city in Texas? Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or were the Stars really not making a profit? Or was the city or whoever owned the arena doing some price gouging? As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly didn't support the team. Opinions, please.	10
Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993. It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) Topics ------ Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo, Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork. Episode Summary --------------- Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc. Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They won in their building, we're going to win in ours". Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against St. Louis. (Don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk resulting in a goal. On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells the Leaf players "Don't let them score on you". Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of instant replay. On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr. Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his play. Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's new rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its all hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the problems. Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article in which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don't fight because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game." Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights, someone gets cut every period. Rating ------ Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported by Murray.	10
Well, Your Majesty, ;^), couldn't you just picture it? Cherry starts doing his first post-game interview with Barrasso; Tommy gives him that little look (like somebody crapped on his shoe) and then proceeds to give Don a tonsilectomy with his Sher-Wood. Now that you could put on pay-per-view! Hope you had a good laugh!	10
: > : > On Tuesday, when it was raining in Chicago, ESPN provided : >bonus hockey coverage. Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off : >that the NY-Wash OT was replaced with the Angels-?? game.

Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox). ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part. But it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, "selfish" when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month? I don't think so. While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers, have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us. There's certainly nothing wrong with that.	10
And Dino Ciccarelli and Ray Sheppard and so on and so on..... : )	10
M --> M --> Look for the Leafs, led by a healthy Doug Gilmour and a confidence-restored M --> Felix Potvin to do the Blues in 6. The Leafs will have 3 more games with the M --> Wings and that should give Joseph a few extra days to pass those horshoes. M --> HA! Roger the dodger is back!

I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked, and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a rock. Also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock by any means at this point. It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos suspensions. No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can convince him to leave school early (which I doubt). My cut on things as they stand today: (it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him. I don't believe they draft him to keep him).	10
^^^^^^^^ In four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen the best player of the opposing team. (In the fifth, the finnish goalie, Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy scorers??? Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally (the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy). It looks like the goalies are getting too good. Is this due to their equipment getting bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger now than they were some years ago). Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way???? Mikko Wihervaara	10

J<--> J<--> Life doesn't get better than this!!!!!!!!! Agreed. <g> - Jack * Tagline Bad or Missing NO CARRIER	10
Well, Dave, I would have to disagree with you there. Satan himself could own the team, and I'd be happy as long as the Oilers stayed in Edmonton. Selfish, but true. I don't want to see the Oilers move, no matter who their owner is.	10
I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional names. Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ will have an effect. And it doesn't say much for the mentality of anybody it works on, either. Surprise, I agree totally. The points system is fine, if everybody at all times has played the same number of games. Since this is almost never the case, winning percentage is the way to go. I don't particularly care if it is an "American" thing either, if it works.	10
and guess which game ESPN is showing in my area on Thursday - yep, Pens-Devils. There are so many other interesting series, who cares about Mario???	10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner. The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on, saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS, USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall. Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are). And everyone gets TNT now. So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between channels every week. But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?	10
It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem. Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it. The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7.	10
Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs. I'm here in a small town in southern Illinois at school. I'm from Canada and I know that cbc and tsn have games on every night, all you have to do is go to a bar with a satellite. I have watched both games between Mon Que and toronto and detroit, not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc. They show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal all playoffs. Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao.	10

... ... We must have been watching two different games. The Devil had one hand on Mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused Mario to fall so the call was appropriate. Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of confidence in your call either. Next time consider getting a second opinion from a clueful observer. Or maybe all those available disagreed.	10
I'd like to echo these sentiments. This is the worst coverage I can ever remember seeing on CBC. As soon as the game ends, I can count to 30, and by that time, they've signed off the air. No post game interviews, no updating of late scores, nothin'. TSN is really putting CBC to shame. I only hope the later round coverage improves, I mean, who really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey. My $.02, Darren	10

But I have to agree.. Boston is a good team.. But streaky... They put together a great streak to capture first place in the Adams, but for what? They have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round, and might not make it out of it. I would love to see the Sabres win the first round, even though I bet on the Bruins (a 12-pack). Oh well, perhaps I should start betting against the Sabres more often! ;-)	10

This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving ESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake. But returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next time, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.	10
They did last world cup and eventually lost tp Sweden in the final!	10
The Fat Lady is about to hit the first note...Okay,how about 3-0 deficits? The B's chances for a comeback are now less 1%(That's based on 7-game playoff format)... He got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats said it all : "Sutter Blue It!". And he did. Harry Sinden's appearance outside of B's dressing room after Game 3 was a pathetic site. He said something really retarded to cover Sutter's behind,"This game is not about winning or losing..". Harry,check the schedule! Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer vacation on Sunday morning! Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the business,Brian Sutter. Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.Louis speaks for itself. The Blues really have a chance to advance to the second round this year...	10
Yes, these last couple of months the Kinngs have failed to show up in about one game in five. Presumably last night was that one game in five.	10
Antonio,you weren't alone. ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion from local sports teams. Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy to be proven wrong! Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble upon a playoff hockey game... ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis. Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion. Good move,ESPN!	10
How much do you watch and follow hockey? The Pens and Bruins will be in the same division next season, which will give Neeley plenty of opportunity to whine about Ulf.	10
It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't call on the Czechs right before their first goal. Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude, when some people throw coins on the ice? Hey, I don't approve the behavior of these guys, especially not in a WC game, but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi' in this connection. Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy). Again: there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows or fighting with other so-called 'fans', who come to a WC just to see if the Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers. Which other sports are you talking about? I don't think soccer is 'every possible sport'. How many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is 'most of them'? If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you think about the Americans? 'Most of them' like beating blacks?	10

Here's one from the mill. The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton where Porklington can get a free deal. Given what Labour relations and Puck has been like, it WOULD be a sigh of relief. This WAY w4e can can BOTH elements!!	10
Yeah I think we're used to it by now. (even if some of us do change our .sigs to root for our second favorite teams :-) I'll be happy if they win it before I get out of school. (the way it's going I may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long) I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement but...... by far the worst "band wagon" fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present). Case in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U. Him - "How 'bout the Pens? The're F-ing awesome" Me - "Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot. Wait until they meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start." Him - "When do the Playoffs start?" Me - "Uhhhh. They started a week ago." I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.

4/23/93 BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0 ----------------------------------------------------- It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were cheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach. Enjoy... By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff: At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than Joseph." It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep. Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks 3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds, a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history. The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4, a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals. The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph. Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way. The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game. The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and scorers, who made the most of their opportunities. Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final period. Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling ``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour ``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye." Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels. The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice. Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty. The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly style is deadly. Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour. Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up. He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58, and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan. The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs. The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues' bench. Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues' power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass. Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice. Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner's pass.	10
If the Leaf's play like they did in game one they're going to need these! Watching that game _really_ hurt! Cheers! i. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------	10
Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School, or the University of Western Ontario, I've never even wondered if there WAS a western Ontario. And judging by the quality of the posts coming from there, I'm still not sure that the place exists. Perhaps I should be impressed, though, since it appears that grade school children in that area have access to the Internet.	10

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and now 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive losses is, if there even is one... I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing streak, since they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that was) Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :) Mike, the insomniaced	10
If ESPN/ABC is going to stick with one-sided Pens-Devils series(and it looks like they will continue with it on Thursday night), I'd rather watch pretty women in the stands than non-action on the ice where a slow,aging NJ team being taken out to lunch by a dynamic Pens squad.	10
ESPN must have some very poor marketing people. They are only concerned with featuring players (i.e. Mario) than featuring good competitive hockey. I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence would prefer the Wales stuff. Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.	10
Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN. I can't get the BLUES games where I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams play except for the Hawks. But last night I got to catch a glimpse of the Caps/Isles game. It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates. His moves are quick and brilliant. You NY fans should be proud. P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?	10
Well I was watching Hockey Hotline last night and Stan said that the station (KBL) had been recieving calls all day concerning this subject. And the verdict was that almost exclusively NOBODY wanted that load mouth, know it all blow hard, former Bruin whiner, Ulf Hating, scum sucking, Pr*ck of missery in Pittsburgh on a permanent basis. That's not exactly what Stan said; I did do a bit of interpriting.	10
: >Showing a meaningless (relatively) baseball game over the overtime of : >game that was tied up with less than 3 seconds left on the clock?	10
: : Speaking of Paddock--what's he doing slagging Sandlak? If Sandlak puts : his mind to it, he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a : real mistake. Isn't Sandbag out with an injury now anyways? Perhaps Paddock meant to say that Momesso was the cheap short artist. After all, that would make more sense.	10
	10
If I were Pat Burns I'd throw in the towel. The wings dominated every aspect of the game. Trying to mix up the lines is a dead end. Murray has too many combinations to counter with. My prediction is wings in 5.	10
What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised. BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first round. Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract then they better put some brains in ESPN people.	10
Gee, they lost to St. Louis twice this year. Maybe you should have your eyes checked. 8^) Go Blues....the Rodney Dangerfield team....They get no respect....except in Chicago mabee...	10
Roger, you should check your facts before posting! The Kings have conceded 12 goals in 2 games.	10
Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach already...and unlike Gil Stein...he didn't get their by stacking the Board of Directors! -) Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't. Bowman is a great coach...Johnson, a very good one. However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.	10

In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in addition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the Bruins every time there is a conflict. You can also get WBAL Baltimore but I don't think they have hockey. BTW, I once got a station from Indiana that had Fort Wayne Comets games.	10
that they out the little writing. Ranger last see Mike went who is the penalties and reason? Islander test hard	10
That's a good way to put it. It's a quiet confidence. I don't feel like I have to defend this team anymore. The Devils are a puzzle to me. They have long been one of the few teams I always dreaded playing. Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough. I just can't figure it out. At least last night they mounted an attack. Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news. He was shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him. Then he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing off and he said, "It just isn't right...it just isn't fair..." and he tried to muster a smile. As far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good. One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri. I'm sure Tom Barrasso knows how he feels. For so long Tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight. Terreri's teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games.	10

The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere. Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial government is months away from a provincial election...it is the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price... and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing. Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them. He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his price if Edmonton doesn't. Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks. It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing. However, in this case, about the long-term financial viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack of money. Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)	10
Hello, Could someone tell me if and where i could find faceoff stats for the 91/92 season and later on the 92/93 (i think its to early to get it now). Thanks a lot	10
Does anyone have the player stats for games played up until April 22,1993.	10
(much mindless drivel deleted) Question to you Canadian folk: is this University of New Brunswick a branch campus of the Western Business School? Seems like the same sort of rectal appendage belongs to both of them.	10
Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly. The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else: Hockey. It's actually a pretty good show and Don isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner. I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure. Don use to coach the Boston Bruins. I don't know exactly when that was. Could someone fill me in on this info? A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday morning. Personally, I've had my fill of Donny! He really pisses me off sometimes. During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that. That's fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show. What gives? It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city. Don Cherry: 'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in> is the best two-way player in the league today.' There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to. Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux. In my opinion, he is an ass. And I won't change my opinion if I'm in a different city. Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get this off my chest.	10

> Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in > their entire 68-year history. Which doesn't mean much since the statistics are mostly based on the 5-game playoff format. But, yes, it looks dark for the B's. What a disappointment. Still, I think the problem is mental. They needed the saves Blue came up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around. Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going to be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.	10
Hindsight's 20-20. Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year. I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough. Gund's offer was the right $, but too late in the season. $2M offered in November lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that). However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan all look like geniuses. A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston (and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you shiver doesn't it. :-) Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one. Are you serious? - Let Ferierra go, - fire Kingston (these last two basically mean that Sharks are starting over again in terms of the timetable to capture the Cup. As I've stated frequently: 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM from inception through Cup season) - broadcast more home games than away games - broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games - jack up my ticket prices from $27 to $38 in two years (not that I'm going to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats. I'll probably next to the virtual 107 folks) - not tell me my priority # - not let me sell my priority # - in order for me to get the free jacket, force me to order my tickets for next season before I get to select my section - not let me park at the new arena after paying for their privileged parking lot (which was sometimes full when I got there) for 2 straight years. I've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of '90 when the team was announced. and I'm not getting that loyalty returned. Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison. And Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all. I know one isn't suppose to make negative comments on signatures, but what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the "Stay in Edmonton" part? I'd never wish the Kings to leave metro-LA; it's too much fun watching the Shark's beat them.	10
The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob Niedermayer, a center (his brother Scott (?) is a defenseman picked by NJ a couple years ago). They brought him in for a physical/tryout a week or so ago. From what I have read Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays BOTH offense and defense, and isn't afraid of physical play. Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of defense prospects (Rathje, Sykora, Ragnarsson), and our centers (Kisio et al) are getting old. With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't see them picking yet another small player like Kariya, he'd just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated shoulder.	10
... That is if Mario makes it. Pat Walker sounds like the type that would bring an AK-47 to a game and take pot shots at Mario. ("stand STILL...dam sunavbich...HMFF")	10
What about including points? Probably no goals (at least against opponents) but there have been several assists given.	10
Does anyone have any information about the world hockey championships and specifically about the US team? Game summaries and/or stats would be greatly appreciated!! USA Today reported that the US beat the Czech Republic, but that was the limit of the story.	10
NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts. I suspect that NESN was only going to sell one telecast to ESPN (remember, ESPN only owns exclusive rights to the FINALS, not the entire playoffs). Since ESPN bought the SCA contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils and Penguins. I think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it. Plus they have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game. I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC. Same exact coverage as last week: Pit-NJ game 4 in the east, Chi-StL in the central, LA-Cgy in the mountains and west.	10
As a guess, Hamilton would be put into the Midwest, with either Winnipeg or Dallas moving to the Pacific.	10
No, Boston probably won't go down easy, but if the Sabres hadn't won game one Buffalo would have been out in four. And what problem are you having with playoff games here in Buffalo???!!!??? There's the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and whatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there's Toronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows. More hockey than a good chunk of North America, either side of the border. It's wonderful, and there are thousands of folks who'd kill to be in your shoes, coverage-wise.	10
I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive site. Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer. Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993 These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date listed above. They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper every Tuesday. They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those are not verified. These stats are available by mail every weekday and sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results. Just send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

Attention Penguins fans once again, apparently 99.999% of you understand that this was just a joke (Hence the :-) next to it) but one idiot on here doesn't as he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e-mails telling me that this is wrong. I have no intentions of sending e-mail to anyone should the Pens win tonight, and I really do not expect/do not intend to lead any of you to send this poster e-mail either. It was NOT a serious request. If you didn't know that (which you probably did) then don't do it. Thanks.	10
Sorry Mike! What defensemen would the Wings be willing to give up for Beezer?	10
Bufflo Sabres has just finished their great four wins over Boston. All Sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players including Mogily, Fuhr, Kemhlev and Lafontin impressed me most. Their skills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the coach's corner.	10
That more or less says it. I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw Ulf cross-check Valeri in the face. I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to go off on this at all in coach's corner. billc	10
Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday? It was tight right down to the last second of the third period. In the overtime Roy and Hextall played like they were gods. Ok, so Montreal won! They deserved it after getting their first goal in overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. Their second goal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal player who kicked it in. The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick. Anyways, Montreal is back into the series.	10

Caps/Isles Fans, Anyone interested in catching the games from Nassau Coliseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch the game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in Chapel Hill. I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well. They had all three games on at the same time last night. This is the only place I know to catch all of the Stanley Cup action.	10

*> *>McGill/Hammond -> Johan Garpenlov.

Same with Wilson. I don't know about Ozolinsh. A judo coach would do more for the Sharks injury situation than Bob Probert. Actually, a judo/ju-jitsu coach could help add a really interesting wrinkle to anyone's game....	10

I'm the tickets Grrrr, let's start a whole 'nother topic on show bad the sharks are doing on these things. I swear that ALL of my partial plan games were televised (I know, I'm exaggerating, but...). In order: -the new ticket prices suck -wait 'till people try to park at games next year. Public transit? Yeah right, I'd love to take caltrain for 3 hours to see a 3 hour game. Shelling out hundreds of dollars for partial season plans for two years doesnt mean anything to the sharks, as I get to pick my seats after the dead rise from their graves to claim their seats! :-) -Frank	10
Yes, Yes, I can see it now >>>> all those Sabre fans FINALLY taking their Sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them. After 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil I guess it is a pretty good bet. BUT there has not been a team that has come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 - could this be the year. (Don't throw out the moth balls yet)	10
Have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? It seems that e.g. glove has become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are wearing "over size" jerseys. Am I dreaming? If you watch old photos or films let say about ten years back, I think the difference is quite obvious. Who is an expert on this, please let me know. (Or have the goalies become bigger?)	10
And you can bet that I wouldn't be the only one not belonging to the moderated group if it was moderated by an anally-retentive little dullard like yourself. I hardly need you to presume to lecture me on how to communicate my points of view. This "posting" that you have made is the second on the subject of the NHL letter and you have yet to communicate your opinion on the matter. Instead you content yourself with flaming me. Result: Moronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage of a perceived opportunity to post rules for others to live by. Well if using it "against" me means you are going to post something of significance then by all means go ahead. I insist. Otherwise why don't you just go back to sleep or do whatever it is that you do when you are all by yourself... --	10
Just some thoughts: I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player, but this time I couldn't resist. During the Pens-Devils game last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face, then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend himself! All Kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh! And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a little out of hand lately. His cheap shots are getting more frequent and more violent. As everybody in the Meadowlands except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat. I've always supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating," but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO. Of course, Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either. It seems that he was following the "The only way to beat the Penguins is to injure them" philosophy. As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day, Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end was pretty exciting.	10
Hooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selanne getting a hat-trick! Of course, here in GOD'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!) I couldn't see that game, nor any other in the VAN-WPG series so far, because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about this series (which has looked pretty competitve so far... On Monday and Wednesday nights, CBC could have shown the Toronto- Detroit game, done the news, then picked up Winnipeg-Vancouver. They didn't. Tonight? You guessed it, Toronto-Detroit, the news (not the end of the Jets game), then Calgary-LA. SO, if it's "Hockey Night in Canada", why can't this Ontarian see one of the two series with two Canadian teams? Is this too much to ask?	10
Tonight will see the Toronto Maple Leafs, as some have guessed, come out hitting! The "Buds" will grind Detroit into the ground and walk away with home ice advantage for the remainder of the series... which given a shift to Toronto, will not last long. (Keep in mind this is only a predicition). Wendall will have to get into the game however otherwise Probert will dominate on the physical front.	10
I heard yesterday that Pocklington was talking with folks at Copps that afternoon (yesterday).	10
And it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent people in rec.sport.hockey. Her sole purpose in mentioning the net, as Steve Gallichio has already pointed out, is to lend weight to her points through association with the internet. There is no other reason to mention the internet. This is misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation Alison would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits. This is not a letter. It is a petition claiming to represent a large proportion of rec.sport.hockey users, and by implication, a significant number of internet users. 65 names can in no way be considered a "large" proportion of rec.sport.hockey which, while we have no way of counting actual readership, is accessible to hundreds of thousands of people. 65 persons is no more than a fly's fart in a windstorm. Gee. You looked up "large" in the dictionary? What next? Two syllable words? Let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of 65 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your IQ scores. As I said, he *might* be impressed by the size of the list of names. But it would have to be considerably larger.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ [underlining mine/Quean Lutibelle] Yes, those who apply it hatefully would be better served if they if they could alter the Bible to reflect their views: Scene 1: A well in Samaria: Woman: But I have no husband. Jesus: Yo! Everybody! Listen up! Get your rocks ready! We'll have some good biblical fun. Here she is whispering to me that she doesn't have a husband, yet I know by my secret powers that she has had five of them! (You know how these Samaritans are! And worse, she's living with a guy now that she's not even married to. Now I believe in loving her, and if you'll just raise up those rocks like the bible allows and threaten her with a good stoning, she'll understand how much we hate the sin but love the sinner. We must keep our priorities strait, lest folks 2,000 years from now misunderstand me and believe I canceled all sin! Scene 2: Golgatha 2nd Thief: You got a raw deal, man. They didn't catch you doing anything wrong like they caught me. Bleeding Jesus: Now, son. Let me be real clear. You say you did something wrong, but are you repenting? I need to be absolutely certain cause if you repent, I have a nice room for you in heaven, but if you think you might go thieving again, I have to cancel your reservation. It is nice of you to have pity on me while I'm hanging here, but you must understand, this is all an act; I'm not really hurting. I'm God, you see. And the point of all this is to teach you to be perfect like me. If you think a simple kind remark to me in suffering is going to get you any favors, you'd better think twice! But if you will just REPENT, you will become a Fundelical in Good Standing. From all such Bad News, you have delivered us, Good God! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Quean Lutibelle/Louie	15
I don't think Joe was saying any such thing. However, your question on "asking Jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have Christ in theirs. Why must Baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. a sudden change of heart, going from not accepting Christ to suddenly accepting Christ? Why can't people start out with Christ from shortly after birth, and build their relationship from there? After all, does a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day? From my experiences, I've learned that all relationships must be built, including one's relationship with God. Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a ritual, but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient. Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ it is necessary to believe in Him. However, the Sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption into God's family on the soul.	15
: You might want to re-think your attitude about the Holocaust after : reading Deuteronomy chapter 28. On the contrary, after the Holocaust, I would be _very_ cautious about my interpretatoin of Deuteronomy 28. Not everything that happens is in accordance with God's will. (You might guess which side of the predestination issue I am on.) I will never _assume_ that evil is punishment by God, especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on _someone else_. For my own life, I will work to discern the hand of God in the evil that befalls _me_. See the discussion earlier on Luke 13.	15
: Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the : standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we : can ask: : 1. Is it authoritative? "Authoritative" is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative. : 2. Is it prophetic? How is "prophecy" to be defined? If it is "speaking forth" of God's message, much of the apocrypha must surely qualify. : 3. Is it authentic? Again, by what standard? Is "authenticity" a function of the authors? the historical accuracy? : 4. Is it dynamic? What is this supposed to mean? Many of the apocryphal books are highly "dynamic" -thought provoking, faithful, even exciting. : 5. Is it received, collected, read and used? By whom? Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some), collected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are, in the Catholic and Orthodox churches). : On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. This is demonstrably false. : To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: : 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and : anachronisms. So do other books of the Bible. : 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices : which are at variance with sacred Scripture. "False" by whose interpretation? Those churches that accept them find no contradiction with the rest of scripture. : 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of : subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. This is a purely subjective evaluation. The apocryphal books demonstrate the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures. (In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal "Additions to the Book of Esther" act rather to bring the "unscripturelike" book of Esther more into line with other books.) : 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine : Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and : poetic and religious feeling. Have you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon? They exhibit every bit as much "poetic and religious feeling" as Psalms or Proverbs. [deletions] : How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who hears the : words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to : them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. : And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will : take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the : holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) : Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions. These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone, not to the whole body of scripture. Revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon. The church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture. : It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no : argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John : 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus : that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the : OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 : taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say : Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture. Jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day, the canon had not been established as a closed collection. The books of the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of the early church). The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e. The Torah (Pentateuch/ "Law") was established in Jesus' day, as were the Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel). The Writings, however, were still in flux. Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the Psalms, which were part of them. The books of the apocrypha were all part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated. To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51 is weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological story. And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the present order) did not exist as such in Jesus' day.	15

Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio) June 25-27. I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this year. I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics. There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers, fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday. Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is available if you need it. Housing in residence halls (each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn. I think it was $47 a night there for my single room. Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast, respectively. Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7. Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from campus. Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer. Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine: Friday afternoon special: Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper. Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S. Lewis. In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis, and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication. Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988. ---------------- Friday evening, opening session: In Search of the Truth: Finding the Fullness of Faith Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz.

This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun reading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will conclude here as well. A week ago, I managed to find time to consult a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library, and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the Jewish scriptures. The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning "lover." This cluster occurs just where one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation) of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH. The verses in question are Hosea 2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel 16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22. [ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and Ezekiel picked up; Lamentations is dependent on, though not likely written by, Jeremiah. ] The "erotic" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is evident. So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like "of the arts" the word "lover" is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship. There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see that standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the Hebrew! :-) More interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine usage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say), _eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very valuable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd context -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the meaning *must* be "say." In addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs), Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, kai e:rasthe" ho basileus Esthe:r -- and the King loved Esther and, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan: kai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra -- and Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David intensely [ I'm using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I don't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ] (The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the "historical" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the "erotic" verb in this context. Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_ for erotic senses, this need not mean anything "more" than _agapao:_ alone would mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this translator goes!)	15
(I presume you are quoting John 3:3-7.) 1. My King James Bible says "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John 3:5). (Here "man" == "adult"). (However, this could be a quibble between translations.) 2. We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing: "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus -- a ruler of the Jews (not a child). 3. We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin? A IDLER	15

: Ok, what's more important to gay Christians? Sex, or Christianity? : Christianity I would hope. Would they be willing to forgo sex : completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, : to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, : etc? If not, why not? Heterosexuals abstain all the time. : (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders : to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life) The difference is that straight members are given the choice of abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only to some. Gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they _must_ be celibate. I don't believe that God gives me a forced choice between having a relationship with God and expressing my heterosexuality (within the context of a faithful relationship). Nor do I believe that God gives that forced choice to gays. Sex or Christianity is a false dichotomy. : To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII : starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is : this a myth). Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are : Christian. For my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at best, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.	15

> A Christian friend of mine once reasoned that if we were never > created, we could not exists. Therefore we were created, and > therefore there exists a Creator. I hesitate to comment on the validity of this, because I do not know what your friend meant by it. If he meant that whatever exists must have been created, then he is open to the obvious retort that God exists, and so God must have been created. Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a time when we did not exist, and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought us into existence. This seems plausible, but an atheist might reply, "So my parents engendered me. So what?" Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of causes is not a satisfactory explanation. He would have some support from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (Ayn Rand, and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle). Having argued for a First Cause, he would have to bridge the gap between said entity and the God of Abraham. If he merely asserts that the things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically unlike them, few physicists would disagree.	15
For your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of Christ) I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern (Chalcedonian) and Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) Orthodox scholars a few years ago (Both families = both Orthodox churches) : 1. Both families agreed in condemning the Eutychian heresy. Both families confess that the Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, only begotten of the Father before the ages and consubstantial with Him, was incarnate and was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect man with soul, body and mind ($ \nu o \upsilon \zeta $); He was crucified, died, was buried and rose from the dead on the third day, ascended to the Heavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as Lord of all creation. At Pentecost, by the coming of the Holy Spirit He manifested the Church as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His glory, according to the Scriptures. 2. Both families condemn the Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of Theodoret of Cyrus. They agree that it is not sufficient merely to say that Christ is consubstantial both with His Father and with us, by nature God and by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature God, became by nature man, by His incarnation in the fullness of time. 3. Both families agree that the Hypostasis of the Logos became composite by uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which He has in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit, created human nature, which He assumed at the Incarnation and made His own, with its natural will and energy. 4. Both families agree that the natures with their proper energies and wills ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ are united hypostatically and naturally without confusion, without change, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ without division and without separation, and that they are distinguished in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ thought alone. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis of the Logos Incarnate. [...] I guess that adresses your question adequately. As for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the discussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an endless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief answer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church regarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc. is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.

You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women sinned, as Paul wrote. All of humanity cooperativley reblled against God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is transmitted from generation to generation.	15
Ezek 22:26 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no difference between the holy and the profane. This brought to my mind a sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said "God's second name does not begin with a D" referring, I believe, to use of God's holy name and titles as swear words. I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at the burning bush when God told him "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground." These and other texts seem to imply that God's people must treat holy things differently from other "common" things, or "make a difference" between holy and common things. The obvious questions are What makes something holy? and How are Christians (primarily) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things? (e.g. God's name, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Bible, etc.)	15
It's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, I think: something about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds more like "love the errant, slay the error". No doubt someone else will know in particular who minted the phrase. If I had to guess, I'd blame :-) St Augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.	15

I have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is; at the least, they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists. In this news group, the liberals don't even know what a fundamentalist is (crying out "legalist" at anyone who believes and obeys God's Word). A fundamentalist would train their children in the way God proscribes, not in the way that man proscribes. This would not include life threatening beatings but would include corporal punishment. To the liberals, I cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe God's Word. Signature follows: "Your statutes are wonderful: therefore I obey them." Psalm 119:129 ========================================================================= David L. Hanson Any opinions expressed are my own! [As most people here know, I believe fundamentalist is sufficiently ill-defined that I advise using some more specific term. I think many people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution). While the original fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, I would think most people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original agenda. (It included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g. the virgin birth.) The term is now being used by the press to describe aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who are attempting to legislate religion. Legalism is yet another ill-defined term. However there is some reason for its use in this context. In fact the common theological definition is the believe that salvation is through the Law. I hope no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this view. However there is a basic difference in approach over what we expect to get out of the Bible. The conservative approach expects to find specific behavioral rules. Generally the posters advocating this approach talk about the relevant passages from Paul's letter as God's Law. The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the culture and other things. It's easy to see why a liberal would regard the conservative approach as legalism. It's hard to know quite what other term to use. The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because no one is saying that Paul made a factual error. Rather, the question is whether his statements are to be taken as Law. Calling the positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology. I haven't seen any good alternative.	15
Marhaba Nabil, If we posit two minds in Christ, the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus, then we must admit two wills. A mind is not a mind without a will. I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined. T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this: _____________ (Mind of Logos) ( _______ ) ( ( ) ) Here, the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the ( ( Human ) ) Son. God the Son has complete access to the human ( ( Mind ) ) mind but the human mind only has access to the mind ( ( ) ) of God the Son when the Son allows access. This ( (_______) ) explains why Jesus said even he did not know the (_____________) time of the kingdom. The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision. But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never the case. He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory. The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing yourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient. The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds. Agreed. But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons. Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation. ==================================== Ted Kalivoda (tedr@athena.cs.uga.edu) University of Georgia, Athens Institute of Higher Ed.	15
Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality. Since it hasn't been posted for some time (and I've modified it somewhat since the last time), I'm taking this opportunity to post it. There is another entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors. They can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality. It contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though primarily from a conservative point of view. ---------------------------- This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and Christians. This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the question each time it occurs. Rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion. It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it. The most common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is "how can a Christian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about it?" First, on the definition of 'homosexual'. Many groups believe that there is a homosexual "orientation", i.e. a sexual attraction to members of the same sex. This is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity. Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable. However in a lot of discussion, the term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex. This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups. In this paper I'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex. I haven't heard of any Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate. I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual. This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'. It is not known whether it is genetic or environmental. There is evidence suggesting each. The best evidence I've seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes. One of them is probably genetic. There are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual. The best-known is Exodus International". The reports I've seen (and I haven't read the detailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the Presbyterian Church's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that these programs have very low success rates, and that there are questions about how real even the successes are. But there certainly are people who say they have converted. However this issue is not as important as it sounds. Those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God. The fact that it's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it's hard to escape from being a drug addict. If it's wrong, it's wrong. It may affect how we deal with people though. If it's very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it. One more general background issue: It's common to quote a figure that 10% of the population is homosexual. I asked one of our experts where this came from. Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source of the figure 10 percent. He defines sexuality by behavior, not by orientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual). According to Kinsey, one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty. Ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually. That was in 1948. The percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey Institute, based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe. I can't put my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online information for Kinsey's own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog at Rutgers: AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.

LC CARD 48005195 This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even been found to hold true in several other cultures, as noted in the recent NEWSWEEK coverstory "Is this child gay?" (Feb. 24, 1992). A journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey's study, but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook...... I've seen some objections to the Kinsey's study, but not in enough detail to include here. (If someone would like to contribute another view, I'd be willing to include it.) Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong. Not all, however. A few denominations accept it. The Metropolitan Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals. However the United Church of Christ also allows it, and I think a couple of other groups may as well. The Episcopal Church seems to accept it some areas but not others. In churches that have congregational government, you'll find a few congregations that accept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably only one or two congregations). But these are unusual -- few churches permit homosexual church leaders. How carefully they enforce this is another issue. I don't have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others. As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here's an attempt to summarize the issues: The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell: "Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality", U Chicago Press, 1980. The argument against is pretty clear. There are several explicit laws in the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality. Beyond these references, there are some debates. Some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant. E.g. the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults. (There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since the entities involved were angels.) It was particularly horrifying because it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong. (This is probably the reason Lot offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked.) If you look through a concordance for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you'll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin. There's a Jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests. At any rate, there's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong. I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most Christians do not consider binding. So unless NT justification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue. The NT references are all in Paul's letters. A number of the references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague. Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not in the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and /arsenokoitai/. Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean. /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing. Boswell suggests "wanton" as a likely equivalent. He also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was that in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has vanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less frowned-upon. (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.) He translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general. A more technical meaning, suggested by the early Latin translations, would be "active mode homosexual male prostitute", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically. For a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee's commentary on I Cor. He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate. However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior. Given what Boswell and Fee say taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very definite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it isn't a general term for homosexuality. While Fee argues against Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same. The big problem with it is that the word is almost never used. Paul's writing is the first occurence. The fact that the word is clearly composed of "male" and "f**k" unfortunately doesn't quite tell us the meaning, since it doesn't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action. Examples of compound words formed either way can be given. In theory it could refer to rapists, etc. It's dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology, or you'll conclude that "goodbye" is a religious expression because it's based on "God by with ye". However since Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on "homosexual male prostitute", that seems as good a guess as any. Note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something which Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation). In my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans 1. Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods. One could argue that this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false gods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual. However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what Paul meant. However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for Christians. What Paul is describing in Rom 1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it's homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness. Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I'm sure Paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex. Given his description of their situation, I rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless. So yes, I do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality. But in all fairness, the "shameless" nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a specific feature of homosexuality. My overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of homosexuality. Rom 1 seems clear. While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases. On the other hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject. Rom 1 is really about idolatry. It refers to homosexuality in passing. The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to Scripture. For those who look to Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT prohibition. For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal, it is not surprising that they regard Paul's negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel. As readers of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described. There's not a lot I can do as moderator about such a situation. A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above. However in fact I'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses. The real issue seems to rest on the question of whether Paul's judgement should apply to modern homosexuality. One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with. He encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong. He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act "straight" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between God and man. It is unfair to take Paul's judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions. Another is the following: In Paul's time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable. It was part of temple prostitution. Among private citizens, it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves. I'm not in a position to say that it always did, but there are some reasons to think so. The ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner. It was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner. (This is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful. His customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.) This supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal. Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children, slaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners. (However Fee's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way. Thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far. Homosexuality may have been discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children.) Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against homosexuality. I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by promiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual. Someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for AIDS. Note that there is good reason from Paul's general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative, apart from any specific statements on homosexuality. I believe his use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what God ordained. However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally. I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one. Paul's tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging. For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms. For another example, Paul obviously would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances) remain unmarried. Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication. I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views Paul expressed in Rom 1. One may believe that homosexuality is not what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still conclude that at times we have to live with it. Note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. This doesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved. The question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it's a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness. If you're willing to consider the latter approach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it. The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail. This is going to depend upon one's assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality. If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it. Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult. However these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality. (Many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality. This includes AIDS. I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to Christian heterosexual relationships.) In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we've heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in this situation. I've also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for "conversion". (Aside from the Presbyterian report mentioned above, there's an FAQ that summarizes our readers' reports on this question.) The evidence is that long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles. The danger in advising Christians to depend upon such a change is clear: When "conversion" doesn't happen, which is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy. Paul recognized (though in a different context) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement. The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality. Maybe homosexuality isn't God's original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian relationships than promiscuity. As with work -- which Genesis suggests wasn't part of God's original ideal either -- I think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God's love with each other. There's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this discussion. The issue is that of "cultural relativism". That is, when Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an eternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time? Conservative Christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative? When looking at this issue, it's worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism. There are a number of judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians consider to be relative. The following judgements are at least as clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality: - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in the OT -- it's not in the NT, but I mention it here because until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding on Christians) - prohibition against swearing oaths - endorsement of slavery as an institution - judgement of tax collectors as sinner We do not regard these items as binding. In most cases, I believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism. Briefly: - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build, but not to our market economy. - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was concerned about - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people how to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as an institution - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to Roman tax farming The point I'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical prohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th Cent. actions are the same. When Christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul would have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors. Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed. (Indeed, slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants or slaves of God.) I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally relative. Rather, I'm trying to say that *some* things are, and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the Bible, that ends the discussion. We need to look at whether the action we're talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the Bible was talking about. If Christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding, I'm willing to listen. Those who claim that the question doesn't need to be looked at are kidding themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above). One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates. When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence -- some laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among Christians seems rather out of proportion. This should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved. This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments. But I can't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources. This is a dangerous situation for Christians. On the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented. One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined. I.e. "God made me homosexual", and I have no choice. I think "God made me homosexual" is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable. But I don't see it as an argument for acceptability.	15

[much stuff deleted] excuse me, but what makes you think that just because he's atheist he doesn't know anything about christianity???? in my (albeit limited) experience atheists are often the ones who know _more_ about the bible, having searched it from end to end for answers. i myself am a christian, but that doesn't mean i consider myself more of an authority on my religion -- i just have a different perspective on it (more biased in favor, naturally :) ). it seems quite obvious why he is subscribed, if i may infer from what motives anyway -- at the very least (although i dislike this kind of logic), one could hope that he will "see the light". critcism will, i fear, not give him a very positive picture of christians.... with regard to this, i guess i don't really feel sentiments of this order can be proven -- faith has a lot to do with it. this is why those who search the bible from cover to cover for answers won't necessarily get what they're looking for. of course that doesn't help anyone who doesn't already have faith -- what a big catch 22. i discovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an explanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature. faith is a very personal thing -- any attempt to "prove" the "facts" behind it must be questioned. likewise -- no matter what you believe.	15

Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely. I am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of Christianity/churches there are. My husband and I come from very different, but completely Christian backgrounds. I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a born and raised Church of Christ member. At first I agreed with a lot of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based. However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine. One of my sorest spots is the role of women. I believe that through Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men (ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc). The last straw was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study. Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call themselves a Christian). Hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with. We are also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new "movement" being led by the young people. So, we have been church hunting with NO success. I want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women). Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their Bibles to service. We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation. If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be thrilled! I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and even harder for me to stay churchless for long. any responses would be welcome the diel family	15
If you don't agree with Joseph's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma of Mary's perpetual sinlessness, then how do you interpret Luke 1:28, And when the angel had come to her, he said, "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women." and Luke 1:48? ...for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace, just as some of filled to the brim, incapable of containing more. The only other people we know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now (another Catholic dogma, based on the communion of saints, as I explained in an earlier post). Full of grace to me means sinless, and anyone who has ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as Mary was sinless. As a Catholic, I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace. But that's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play. I pray God to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ, which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church. And, as you probably know, faith in Christ's Church is tantamount to faith in Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ's Mystical Body. A Catholic by nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ: (1) a personal faith in Christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the Church as the body of Christ. -- Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechist gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu	15

[bible verses ag./ used ag. homosexuality deleted] also check out the episcopal church -- although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women, there certainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are. i am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous homosexual relationship. this in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his community, as well as a very significant aids ministry. my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel God thinks about this. obviously my conclusions may be wrong; nonetheless they are my own and they feel right to me. i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did NOT know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly _inherent_ rather than completely learned. this means that to a certain extent -- or to a great extent -- homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about other people -- which is why reports of "curing" homosexuals always chill me and make me feel ill. please not that, although i can't cite sources where you can find this information, there is homosexual behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals, which is in itself suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned, or at least that the word "unnatural" shouldn't really apply.... please remember that whatever you believe, gays and lesbians shoul not be excluded from your love and acceptance. christ loved us all, and we ALL sin. and he himself never said anything against homosexuals -- rather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as "women shouldn't speak in church" and "women should keep their heads covered in church" -- not exact quotations as i don't have my bible handy) who says these things. i have a tendency to take some of the things paul says with a grain of salt.... well, that's all i'll say for now. vera noyes	15
What is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal suffering? If it is Biblical, please reference. Here's my train of thought: If God is using the Earth to manufacture heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain yield, and a certain amount of waste. The yield goes to Heaven, and the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell. Why is it necessary to punish the waste, rather than just destroy it? Peace and joy,	15
Yes, but no more than he is worth. :-). Seriously: Jerome is merely (and grandly) another Christian witness, to be taken for what he can tell us. He is one in the community of saints. You seem to wish for a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant thought than seems to me, from a historical perspective, to be valid. To be sure, Rome rejects (some significant aspects of) Protestant thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject (some significant aspects of) Roman thought. Other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection, on either side, there is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume. Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans, as well as those between Rome and the Anglican communion (to which I belong) show very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity. Thus, for example, as you go on to say: Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as opposed to political) significance. Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't. You misread me if you think that my communion, at least, "throws out" the deuterocanonical books. Nor do I think you should overstress the sense in which the more Reformed may do so. I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here. It verges on, and could be taken as, anti-Semitic in the worst sense. The "unbelieving" Jews were, according to what I understand as a Christian, the chosen people of God, and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation. I think they have some say in the matter. The Javneh meeting should not be over-interpreted. A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ (I don't have more citation information on hand, sorry) produced primarily from the background of Christian (rather than specifically Jewish) scholarship suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering question, where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple, and thereby "made the hands unclean" when used. The list of "sacred books" that may be drawn up from Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book, if I rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh. All of this is not to "throw out" the deuterocanonicals (what, by the way, is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not? :-)) -- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment does not do it justice.	15
In response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of homosexuality, clh poses the following challenge: I answer, The circle is simple to break. The Church teaches that homosexual behavior is immoral. This teaching is raw, impassionate, unassailable dogma. That closes the argument for me. -- Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechist gt7122b@prism.gatech.edu	15
Though this will be addressed in the series of articles I'm posting now under "ARESNOKOITIA", I can't wait. This just really blew my socks off. Read I Tim 1: 3-11. Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the Mosaic Law. In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is "homosexuals." The decalogue, above everything else, is seen as God's absolute. If you don't believe in absolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul reveals to be the Messiah of the NT. "Lord Christ Jesus" transliterates to read "Jehovah's Anointed Savior." In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20. In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards) is not found in Lev 18-20. Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX. He knew full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for application in the NT. As I've said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away with. This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being posted. Please refer to it. We can do better than "probably" which is not an adequate defense against the statement that Paul's culture didn't have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours. Again read the article because it uses facts. I think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with AIDs patients. The pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however. Those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend, yet you continue to witness to him. But, once the choice is made, and there is no remorse, then I feel that Paul's "pastoral" care, as presented in the Corinthian Church, come to bear significance. THe one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer, then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand. If there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn't hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly. That, in part, betrays the present "political correctness" of the issue. Pederasty is not accepted at the present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet. THis is how the morals decay. I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics. The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own states, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax incentives to these same richies. It comes down to a moral code of relativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment. --Rex	15

The following is a juxtaposition of part of an ancient text known as "de Sacramentis", usually attributed to St. Ambrose of Milan, and the canon of the traditional Catholic Mass of the Roman rite. The conclusion from this comparison is that the central part of the traditional Roman canon was already fairly well in place by sometime in the late 4th century. Taken from "The Mass of the Western Rites", by the Right Reverend Dom Fernand Cabrol, Abbot of Farnborough, 1934, without permission.

The moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon: Moderator: Nabeel A. Rana <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu> Co-Moderator: Dr. Tahir Ijaz <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca> A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA ISLAM: =============================================== The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was found in 1889 in Qadian, India. The founder of this movement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah. The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United Nations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement, but so far to no avail. Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds. The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism. Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals. The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood. NEWSGROUP CREATION: ================== The discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more "YES/Create" votes than "NO/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: ==================== Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup. He has no objection to use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora- do, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup. They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS: ===================== Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to: Nabeel A. Rana <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>	15

It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of Original Sin. This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism. Even among, its supporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell. It's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine. However, if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based, then we can come to an understanding of the truth. Let's now take a more complete look at scripture. Colossians 2:11-12 "In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead." In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a personal faith in the power of God. Our parent's faith cannot do this. Do infants have faith? Let's look at what the Bible has to say about it. Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?' Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ." So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel. Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached. Kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to God's word. Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life. Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's sins. So we can have no original guilt from Adam. Ezekiel 18:31-32 "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!" The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit. Kids cannot do this. Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we will then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit. Then we shall live. Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not Biblical, let's look at some of the scriptures used to support it. Romans 5:12 "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--" Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned. Death came to each man because each man sinned. Note that it's good to read through all of Romans 5:12-21. Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing. Let's look at one such. Romans 5:19 "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous." Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner. In the same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous. We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam. Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself. I encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn't all fit together. Psalm 51:5 "Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before God in repentance for sinning. David himself was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband. All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time when he wasn't sinful. He is humbling himself before God by confessing his sinfulness. His saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole. The Bible, being inspired by God, isn't limited to a literal interpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25). For another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26. Now then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with other children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc. Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling is always that they don't know any better. Let's look to see if the Bible agrees with my gut feelings. Isaiah 7:14-15 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right." Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about Jesus. If they don't, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new leader. Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal human babies. Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong. We see that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52. The implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong. Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don't know to choose the right instead of the wrong. Jesus himself was baptized, albeit with John's baptism, not as an infant, but as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23). Immediately afterwards, he was tempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13). Thank you for your attention. Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while. Perhaps you would like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up. Feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ. Sincerely, Aaron Cardenas aaronc@athena.mit.edu	15
I recall reading somewhere that a number of bishops spent a great deal of time debating the topic of "how many angels could fit on the tip of a needle". Does anybody have a reference to this? Thanks	15
In the Monday, May 10 morning edition of the San Jose Mercury News an article by Sandra Gonzales at the top of page 12A explained convicted killer David Edwin Mason's troubled childhood saying, "Raised in Oakland and San Lorenzo by strict fundamentalist Christian parents, Mason was beaten as a child. He once was tied to a workbench and gagged with a cloth after he accidently urinated on his mother when she walked under his bedroom window, court records show." Were the San Jose Mercury news to come out with an article starting with "Raised in Oakland by Mexican parents, Mason was beaten...", my face would be red with anger over the injustice done to my Mexican family members and the Mexican community as a whole. I'm sure Sandra Gonzales would be equally upset. Why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the San Jose Mercury News when it is pointed at the christian community? Can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in this kind of a newspaper? This is really bad journalism.	15
My feeling on baptism is this: parents baptize their baby so that the baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death. That is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young to speak on its own. This should not surprise anyone: don't parents *always* do what they believe is the best for their baby? Why would that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual needs to have God's grace? The purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her parents made at baptism. That is where accepting Jesus into your heart comes in. In baptism, the parents ask Jesus to come into their baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request independently.	15
It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision, but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con- sciousness, translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it wrong. Not that he did it rationally, but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images, instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound. This difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult, even for the prophets of old. That is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations. Likewise, the Apostles seemed to feel that the return of the Lord was to be "very soon" in the sense of perhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of "very soon" has proven to be different than they could grasp. Prophetic vision tends to telescope time, so that things that are far off appear to be very close. Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which was thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy. There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober Christians (and others too). It seems that great coming events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these "apocalyptic" times. The various predictions (I'm talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com- pletely. One has the feeling "something is about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen". We are living, as the Chinese saying goes, in interesting times. As for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn't help much. There is an Old Testament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass. That helps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth- quake it is small comfort. It seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they are necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space. For what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict coming events. His answer was that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti- cipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw. If this is in fact a spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law, knowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious. I.e. I would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did. However, I can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had, I too might feel impelled, and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what I had seen.

> I'm leaning... SIRACH... is more directly referenced by JAMES > than JOB or RUTH is... in any NT verse I've seen. It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and from JAMES. Job 5:13 ("He taketh the wise in their craftiness") seems to be quoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19. James 5:11 ("You have heard of the patience of Job"), while not a quote, implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience. It is possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew Bible, but rather another similar and related story. (One has the same problem with direct quotes.) Again, Matthew 1:5 ("Boaz begat Obed of Ruth") tells us that Matthew knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz and became the ancestor of David. Since Ruth is not mentioned in the OT outside the Book of Ruth, it seems likely that Matthew was familiar with the book and respected it, and thought Ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy. References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical. But neither do direct quotes.	15
Well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT (this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)? OFTEN, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people. Several times in the OT, this is pointed out, even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin for several generations. Even today, we see multi-generational (to coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal abuse just to name three. So, God's definition of fair and ours differ. Some points of perspective: Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see Webster's first definition of inbred) thanks to Adam, it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes. I know myself pretty well, and I'm just not that good. Take God's word for it, neither are you. "There is no one righteous..." More important, when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus, God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful tendency. We can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (Rom 7,8) "...God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes." -Eccl Mark	15
The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon used by the Greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church. They were not added later (or much later). This is a common misconception. The preference of the Hebrew canon over the Greek canon is a later innovation. The church did not need to be guided to "add" the books since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and passed to the Church. Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --	15
I would put it stronger than that. I consider it nonsense. Simply put, I do not see any way that a "Platonic essence" could have any *real* existance. "Essence" in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways. So, to attribute an 'essence' to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist!! Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence', thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address. Thus, to me, the unity of God must be primary, and the triality must be secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one. -- sarima@teradata.com (formerly tdatirv!sarima) or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com	15
I'm looking for the following article: ``The War Within: an Anatomy of Lust'' Leadership 3 (1985), pp 30-48 I've looked in the libraries of 3 UK Bible Colleges, but none of them subscribe to the Magazine (its a US publication, btw). If anyone has access to this article and would be willing to post me a photocopy (I presume that copyright restrictions will allow this?), please e-mail me. Thanks,	15
Are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups (such as the Christian Coalition) out there? I come from a very liberal background, and I'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a public forum (such as this one.) I frankly can't understand the rationale or Christian basis for much of the conservative position, and I'd like to try and learn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church. Is anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint? Thanks.	15
I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and muslims are free to so so in other groups as well. It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are wrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists. Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views. Cheers, Kent	15
Fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that "we" (conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument... But isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly "new" [this century] ? Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint before this century? I don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality is "acceptable to Him". So your scripture quotation doesn't work for "us".	15
... The so-called Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith in the Orthodox Church. It was introduced (without the Filioque) in certain service-books in the 17th and 18th centuries at a time when there was a strong Western influence on Orhtodoxy.	15

Yes, there are these two senses of interpretation, and certainly our decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own private opinion. However, when reading Scripture, we have to remember that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction, and that the interpretation that matters is the one God intended. For example, if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the doctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended interpretation. The prophets didn't make up this teaching; it came from God, and we must accept it as such. This necessarily means that our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God intended to convey. Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to determine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically accepted as the infallible interpretation of God. We need to test the spirits to see if they are from God. When the Holy Spirit speaks, he says the same thing to all; he won't tell me that a passage means one thing and tell you it means another. If the two of us come to conflicting conclusions, we can't both be completely right. We know our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole agrees on what Scripture means. This is how we know the doctrines of the Trinity, the dual nature of Christ, etc. infallibly. These matters are not up for private interpretation. This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teachers. They preferred their own private interpretation to the God-given teaching of the apostles. It is through such private interpretation that the traditions of men, so soundly denounced in Scripture, are started.	15
Andrew - continuing the discussion on the Deuterocanonicals... Arguably, it is both. Since authority is a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example "Jesus is Lord" whether the world at large accepts the authority or not. Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative content whether or not it is accepted (This issue is at the heart of Pilate's pragmatic question "What is truth?" to Jesus when our Lord was brought before Him. Jesus' reply was to appeal to the authority of his Father) You also might like to consider the claimed authority represented by the statements "thus says the Lord" in the Bible, which claim to put across the exact words of God. You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the "community of faith" - does something become truth because it is accepted? The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to Rev 22 came in.) If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the book: Jesus' standards were that "Scripture cannot be broken". Can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the Apocrapha? (ie definitely fulfilled AFTER it has been written) Does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for example) What this is getting at is the relationship between text and reader. It is to do with the quality of writing, which should have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this in Jesus' quote: "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord". (Matt 4.4) Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? Certainly it is not as widely used as the OT and NT. Think about what I have said above. You may want to revise your conclusion. In addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg the Koran, the book of Mormon and how and why you would categorise them using the above principles. One word of caution - you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the Bible. Remember that Lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel of light and quoting Scripture. What were you thinking of? We've lost the point and the context here. I am not arguing that the statement in Rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from man-made traditions - but there is I believe an act of God involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as Scripture and comes under the definition of 2Tim 3.16.	15
comments : ^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ There is a BIG difference between the status of what you refer to as Alexandrians (actually, this includes all Oriental Orthodox Churches and not only Copts) and that of Nestorians. The Oriental Orthodox Churches never even "shelter" Eutyches (the advocator of Monophysitism) but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his heresy. That is why the Eastren (Chalcedonian) Orthodox Church held talks with the Oriental (non-Chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is Christology (I have more details of the inter-Orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested). So I do not see how the "Alexandrians" and the Nestorians are in a similar position. Peace,	15
I have been studying the Bible now for about a year. I love it, but I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or traditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups. I have heard various people (outside this news group) describe *idols* such as power, money, material possessions etc. These things are worshiped in some sense I suppose, but I never really gave idols much thought. Until now... I have been reading the postings in this news group (which I just found a few days ago), and I have a question... First, I'm not trying to question anyone's belief or try to push my views on anyone else (I haven't been at this long enough to have any views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good, I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that I could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that every time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in Christ's side because He took the punishment for my sins, when He died on the cross). In my studies, Mary never really comes up. I know who she is, but that's about it. It seems to me that a statue of Mary could be considered an idol? Do people pray to statues of Mary? It sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself I'm sure) believe Mary was sinless? Wow... I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about Tongues (I'm reading "Charismatic Chaos"). I guess I'll study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group. Any help you can give me will be appreciated. ------------------------------------------- [I don't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a different tradition than yours. This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants. Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless. Protestants do not. The issue comes down to different sources of authority. Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine. Since this isn't in the Bible (except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they didn't already believe it), Protestants don't accept it. Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible. I interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am not prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own. Catholics are of course a major one, but by no means the only one. I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and various subsets of Protestantism. Within Protestantism, it's a matter of how finely you want to cut things. These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who don't. There are also a number of major historical traditions, but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur. I'd identify the major Protestant traditions as: Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they're sort of halfway between Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal, Church of Christ But there are a number of others. Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general "evangelical" perspective. But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked. I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history. Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now. A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and give a feeling for their nature. Unfortunately I'm away from my library at the moment, so I don't have anything specific to recommend.	15
I don't see how this logically follows. True enough, Mary received a blessing beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be the mother of the Savior. It says nothing about Mary needing to be a "blessed person" _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of God. Again, I think the problem is that as humans we can't comprehend how the sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God's Spirit. Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God, we must needs try to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be. Mary's own words, "...my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden,..." sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity, in need of a Savior, similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms...not the words of a holy being with no further need for God's grace. I really apologize for harping on this, I don't suppose it's important. It's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid, serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose to come down to you and I, to be born of people like you and I, to share our existence and redeem us from it's fallenness by his holy Incarnation.	15
but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm." Proverbs 1:33	15
"We however, shall be innocent of this sin, and will pray with earnest entreaty and supplication that the Creator of all may keep unharmed the numbers of His elect." -St. Clement, Bishop of Rome, Letter to the Corinthians, 59.2, (c. 90 AD) "Ignatius also called Theophorus, to the Church at Ephesus in Asia, which is worthy of all felicitation, blessed as it is with greatness by the fullness of God the Father, predestined from all eternity for a glory that is lasting and unchanging, united and chosen in true suffering by the will of the Father in Jesus Christ our God..." -St. Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, Letter to the Ephesians, Address, (c 110 AD) "We say therefore, that in substance, in concept, in orgin and in eminece, the ancient and Catholic Church is alone, gathering as it does into the unity of the one faith which results from the familiar covenants .... those already chosen, those predestined by God who knew before the foundation of the world that they would be just." -St. Clement, Patriarch and Archbishop of Alexandria, Miscellanies, 7.17.107.3, (c 205 AD) Of course the doctrine was explained more fully later on by Sts. Augustine, Aquinas, etc., but the seeds were ther from the beginning. I think you are reading it wrong. I say those who are not saved are not saved on account of their own sins. It is not because God did not give them sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men might be saved. However, as only some are saved - and those who are saved are saved by the grace of God, "not by works, lest any man should boast" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to heed the call of God. They are damned by their own free will and chosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not predestined, but reprobated instead. Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly. If He did, no one could have their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing God to withdraw His grace). But, you are correct - the world is divided into those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the road to perdition. THe key is that God knows it and we do not. Thus, no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect and predestined. But no one who is a Christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God). You must admit it is possible. Anyway, why would you want something in the hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven? Better to lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said. This is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who are rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them their blessing know, as they have chosen. Remeber, Jesus promised tribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are Christians. He did not promise heaven on earth. He promised heaven. Not really. Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it in Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15). Those with poorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for whatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)). Of course, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul. And no comments were taken as flames. You are one of the more polite people I have talked to over the net. Andy Byler	15
My first and most important point is that regardless of how your recovery happened, I'm glad it did! On 10-May-93 in Re: How I got saved... NOW! The point that I'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur with a very high frequency. How many of us have been thinking of someone and had that person call? Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily explicable by this - one forgets the misses. Consider your astrological forcast in the newspaper. How many times have you said "That's me" vs "That's not me"? You'll remember the hits, but the misses will be much more frequent. On 10-May-93 in Re: How I got saved... And what if, instead if being healed, your affliction got much worse and you ended up paralyzed? Would you have attributed that to god as well? Or would that have been the work of satan? If you believe that would have been so, why ONLY good from god, and ONLY evil from satan? Couldn't the agony have come from god? Think about what he did to poor Job!

From: dhammers@pacific.? (David Hammerslag) How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit. Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called "The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews of Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the son of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage. Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was her only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning" (6:17). Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting story to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter than Esther. The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16. "Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world. "Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory."	15
Yes, Mary is fully human. However, that does not imply that she was just as subject to sin as we are. Catholic doctrine says that man's nature is good (Gen 1:31), but is damaged by Original Sin (Rom 5:12-16). In that case, being undamaged by Original Sin, Mary is more fully human than any of the rest of us. You ask why God cannot "repeat the miracle" of Mary's preservation from Original Sin. A better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ He not" do it that way, but you misunderstand how Mary's salvation was obtained. Like ours, the Blessed Virgin Mary's salvation was obtained through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross. However, as God is not bound by time, which is His creation, God is free to apply His Sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before Christ came to Earth, from our time-bound perspective. Therefore, Christ's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and were necessary even for Mary's salvation.	15
I don't know either. Truth be known, so little is known of angels to even guess. All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in the nativ tongue of the person they're talking to, so perhaps they don't have ANY language of their own. Well, we are told to test the spirits. While you could do this scripturally, to see if someones claims are backed by the bible, I see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really was dead and now he's alive. It's a common fallacy you commit. The non-falsifiability trick. How can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen? Answer: I can't. The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove anything. When I say it has never been proven, I'm talking about the ones making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving. The burden of proof rest with the claimant. Unfortunately, (pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end pontification). But truthfully, Corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just so poorly translated into English) that much remains unknown about just what Paul really intended (despite claims of hard proof one way or another). Some will see his writings in 1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using sarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.	15
Are you sure you want to include Chalcedon here? I presume that you mean the description of Jesus as fully human and fully devine. Almost everyone would consider the majority of Copts and Armenians, and the Jacobites, as Christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained that they disagree with the Formula of Chalcedon. Those that wouldn't consider them Christians are most likely to object that these communities don't require a personal commitment to Jesus, which is only tangentially related to the Formula of Chalcedon. -- Thanks, John Kolassa, kolassa@bio1.bst.rochester.edu	15
which Kenneth Engel challenges: I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as literal. The point is that God understands the suffering we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV, but _really_ understands, He can "feel" our pain. This fact is manifested by Jesus' life. We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus, we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair, but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us, He is in everyone, whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him, and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Him. Now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities, but that wasn't my goal. Thankfully our moderator is surprising. As I re-read this I must admit that this is more of a description of my faith than an explanation, but perhaps that's all I can do, hopefully that's all I have to do.	15
Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall: "The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." (Gen 2:15, NIV). Work was God's design from the beginning. -- Ken	15
There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual. I saw another figure that listed 2% as the figure. Of course, even if it were 99% that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior. How many people have commited other acts of fornication? How many people have lied or sinned in other ways? Why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality? Paul describes "men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts. Sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man's not glorifying God as God and being thankful. Still, their acts were shameless. Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer. Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit. The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways. I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus. If the Law is reflection of God's character and true holy nature, then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem. If homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, endorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus. This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that this was the case. Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime! Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament? Take a look at I Corinthians 5. Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. There is a prohibition against having your father's wife in Leviticus. No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides this one.) Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife. Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either. And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either. As a matter of fact taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the Gentiles. It was just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or not. One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems. Sin can be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power. Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin, like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex? I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse. God is greater than all of it. Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation. How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God? Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed. That is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not God's willingness and ability to change a sinner. Any program that uses formulas may fail. What people need is the power of God to change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other sin. I don't see how you come to that conclusion. Paul's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult. Take the example of eating meat offered to idols. Paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with eating the meat. Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others. But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough. Paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof." (Romans 13:14) Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others. Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts. Since others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul's approach on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex. Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual "marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin. Yet marriage itself is not a sin. marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains, and Paul recognizes this. Actually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell. After he fell he would have to toil over the ground. That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it. We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just like anyone else. I'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion. It's like saying, "How should I kill myself, with gun or aresenic? What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats? Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat, or all of them? What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them? In all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher the chance that they will get a disease. But this only deals with physical aspects of the question. Whichever sin is commited, it all leads to spiritual death. The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act. Second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving relationships?" There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love." (btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes. Also, where do you get that tax collectors are sinners. That's certainly not explicit. Jesus didn't tell Zachias to quit his job.)

speaking of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin: Yes. For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers, consider: You alone and your Mother are more beautiful than any others; For there is no blemish in you, nor any stains upon your Mother. Who of my children can compare in beauty to these? -- St. Ephrem the Syrian, Nisibene Hymns, 27:8, around A.D. 370 Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary, a Virgin not only undefiled but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate, free of every stain of sin. -- St. Ambrose, "Commentary on Psalm 118", 22:30, ca. A.D. 388 There are many others. No. We have, for instance: Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of Holy Mary, and being questioned, did not immediately add, "the Virgin"? ... And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman remains undefiled. -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, "Panacea against all heresies", between A.D. 374-377. We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal King, with the seed of human intercourse. Anyone who proposes this is merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin. -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of Thessalonica, A.D. 392 Note that St. Augustine's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387. I don't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I'm quite sure it was after 392. The belief in Mary's perpetual virginity originated long before Augustine's time. We hold that it originated with the Apostles. Strictly speaking, however, Mary's perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Conception. Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Conceived. No. It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception, when a person's life begins. Biology had nothing to do with it. Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Mary's sinlessness, and the means by which God could have achieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Conception. Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine, but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones. The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21). No. First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not based on private revelation. The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation, which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle. Second, the "case for the doctrine" was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull "Ineffabilis Deus" by Pope Pius IX. This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be believed by the faithful. The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later. The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never claimed that, nor shall she.

Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on numerology. (That's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another. I can never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to prove.) Somebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying things like "this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else these patterns would not appear". Then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the other numerology posts. Stuff like "The word `numerology' adds up to 28, and the word appears 28 times in the posting! Such elegant planning! Further, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!" (These examples are made up by me just as examples.) I really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing that these patterns can be found in just about anything. However, I did not save a copy of it. I do not remember the author. I'm only 90% sure that it was posted to this newsgroup. BUT, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the author is reading here, I wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy. (I think it should be made into an FAQ, if we can find it.)	15
Not exactly correct, but nice try. The Catholic doctrine of infallibility refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in matters of faith or MORALS. It is this teaching which is taken as doctrine.	15

Aside to the moderator: I won't quote any of it, but there are several errors in the article. Not things that are just differences of opinion, but the writer just plain has his facts confused. For example, Kip McKean was *asked* to come to the Lexington church by the leaders there. He brought no team. He actually had been in Charleston, IL up to that point. He had many friends, even leaders in Gainesville, telling him not to go, because people in the Northeast weren't "open" and he'd be wasting his time and talents. Really!!

Larry - Thanks for the reply, but this isn't quite the same thing. Like I said before, I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret. In fact, all four gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail. Communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of the Body of Christ. The fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact hiding shameful things from the general public. In fact, I think if you read some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all bashful about describing what went on during communion. That's why it seems funny to me when Mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st century Christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they are "too sacred." - Mark	15
On Sunday 9 May 1993, Kenneth Engel writes (in substance): We are told that the penalty for sin is an eternity in Hell. We are told that Jesus paid the penalty, suffering in our stead. But Jesus did not spend an eternity in Hell. This objection presupposes the "forensic substitution" theory of the Atonement. Not everyone who believes in the Atonement understands it in those terms.

A recent post bears the subject line: > Re: Serbian genocide work of God? The text contains 80 lines devoted to a defence of the doctrine of predestination as applied to the salvation of individuals. There is then a five-line post-script on the Balkans. It is natural and easy to keep the Subject line of the post that one is replying to, but when the focus shifts, keeping the same Subject can cause confusion. This is intended as a general request. The post mentioned is just the handiest example.	15
(stuff deleted) [First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment. Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.]	15
This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on this issue. We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief! There is no wonder that your "miracle" does not work. You designet it yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like the one you describe, I see no reason why your "miracle" should really happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans! After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you? Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others. Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know. But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked. In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He said that "I do nothing, except what my father tells me." Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example! In Him, Bjorn	15
This is misleading, at best. The question, really, has to do with the status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture. And the issue predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the "deuteroncanonicals" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the Hebrew one.) His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just dictating his translation to an amanuensis. That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the first steps in "reducing" these books from the status they had (and have) among the Greeks. Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers "threw out" these books. Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these ALONE. I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek) are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident. It also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow "more inspired" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable -- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in Greek (or German, or English, ...). This tendency seems to have got a big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current "inerrancy" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated. If we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of course, Anglicans don't do so :-)). For texts originally in Greek, it would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative. BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome, above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two of four have been published so far.	15
A friend of mine managed to get a copy of a computerised Greek and Hebrew Lexicon called "The Word Perfect" (That is not the word processing package WordPerfect). However, some one wiped out the EXE file, and she has not been able to restore it. There are no distributors of the package in South Africa. I would appreciate it, if some one could email me the file, or at least tell me where I could get it from.

The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News. I guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this church. I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor. I also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed. Unfortunately, this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is perceived to approach. There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any cost' style of theology. I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into this equation? Baptisms draw parents' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs told they'd be killed by bee stings if they didn't submit to religious rite. By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau Colorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a Baptist minister. Doxens of children, some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents, thought they were going to a carnival at the Cornerstone Baptist Church, where there would be a big water fight, free balloons, squirt guns and candy. Before that May 1 carnival was over, however, children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized. In many cases they consented, although they or their families are not of the Baptist faith. The baptisms by the church have angered many parents, including Paulette Lamontagne, a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent. 'My understnading was they were going to a carnival. I feel that's a false pretense,' said Lamontagne. Her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized. Cornerstone church officials defended their actions. 'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded us to baptize converts. No one can show me one passage in the Bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized,' said Dan Irwin, associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church. Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because 'they didn't ask,' Irwin said. Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children's friends who were members of the Cornerstone Church. Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children, but indicated the parents could pursue civil action. ------------------------------------------- Aren't these the same behaviors we condemn in the Hari Krishnas and other cults? [I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions. First, I'm not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required. This would be extremely difficult, because of the clear commandment to obey parents. But if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents' consent, I might be willing to do it. However this would be a serious step, and would warrant much careful discussion. The problem I find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody's consent. Whether you believe in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a Christian community. If there isn't a commitment from *somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of the Church, the baptism appears to be a lie. Furthermore, it is likely to raise serious practical problems. What if the child is from a baptist tradition? Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized. But he already has been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church. So does he get rebaptized? Neither answer is really very good. If not, he's being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.	15
Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that "a Christian is one who not only believes in God, but believes God." After all the name was first given externally to identify those who "preached Christ and Him crucified" to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before God. God said this was His son -- I belive Him. -- Scott Dittman email: sdittman@wlu.edu University Registrar talk: (703)463-8455 fax: (703)463-8024 Washington and Lee University snail mail: Lexington Virginia 24450	15
I'd appreciate some support for this statement. I'm not sure it really makes sense to me. I've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal's wager? I don't know. You point out that your mother's treatment upset you, and see inconsistencies in various religions. I'm not sure if that constitutes broken-ness or not. It certainly consititutes disillusionment.	15
Yes, I suppose that's true. Of course, notice I qualified with NEARLY every language :-). And there are missionaries out there who can speak every imaginable language AND dialect. But then, the fact that not all languages have a WRITTEN gospel lends no credence to the concept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full of people who do have a written language and a Bible in that language.	15
The Christian Reformed Church does not allow people to belong to lodges, the Reformed Church in America does. The conservatives in both churches are very similar, as are the "progressives". The RCA currently ordains women; the CRC is fighting over the issue.	15
Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin, part II Let me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition of male-male sex. In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I'll also stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the term for this usage. The question I want to turn to is what that would mean for Paul's readers and for later Christians. This should be shorter than my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within Christ's body, and I am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow Christians. My own biases (loosely characterizable as "liberal") will be evident, but I am not grinding an axe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD to reach "closure" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ. So; stipulating Paul's intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS READERS UNDERSTAND this intent? And following on that question, there is a second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him? Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st Corinthians, there are two "positive" answers and one "negative" to this question: + a. Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem- nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no futher explanation. [I should note that there is no evidence in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)] + b. The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul, what God means "behind" Paul's inspired word-choice.) - c. We *don't* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre- cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul, in the same passage of the word _pleonektai_ ("those who have more" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is "obvious" from its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word! The NEB translates it as "grabbers") or even _methusoi_ ("drunkards" -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult, so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!) The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards tradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical demand for evidence. All three positions have strengths and weaknesses. _ad_ a: It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the community of Christ's disciples and their successors, and that our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition. But it's also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generations of possibly confused transmission. The scripture is itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era. _ad_ b: If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an attempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under- standing the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze. But the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent understanding supposedly derived from the "clear" Word of God. [Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture; the more bizarre forms of "I will read Scripture my way" are primarily a fringe aspect of "cultic" Protestantism.] The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel *is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible conflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind "convinced" that he is led by the Spirit. No one can seriously urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian against Christian. To what purpose? _ad_ c: The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open to all. The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually possible. :-) [If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias; one complaint against critical methodology is that it "dissolves" faith -- but surely a "faith" that cannot honestly face the evalu- ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to address.] Anyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between "liberal" and "conservative" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c. A Catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will. And Anglicans will (I predict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position its due, but no more than its due. Second question. Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of "spiritual" Christians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible, that Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against male-male sex. What then? Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer. But it's precisely where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they're most dangerous. We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of tradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them). We have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question. Jesus and Peter and Paul do not so much "throw out" tradition as subject it to radical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds: "the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith" (Matthew 23:23) and "On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law, and the Prophets, also." (Matthew 22:40) If there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts (vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus' reported words and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge. All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men. That God may lead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction I will freely grant. But tradition is inherently human, and inherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt). Nothing in it is immune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy and good faith. Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from love of God and love of neighbor. I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin. That the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am too dense to learn). That tradition *might* have value here. But what I *know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated "sodomites" as the "cause" of the earthquake, so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense. If that is in accord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian. That is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious. And I see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand. If that is the leading of the Spirit, then I want no part of it. But what I have found in obedience to the Lord is that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians, for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ. And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church: "be careful how you deal with these people... If this enterprise, this movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of its own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not only be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves fighting against God." [Acts 5:36...39] All I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our first Christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of God and neighbor. Then, study the evidence; learn the history of Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge. And let the witness of the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God's truth. -- Michael L. Siemon I say "You are gods, sons of the mls@panix.com Most High, all of you; nevertheless - or - you shall die like men, and fall mls@ulysses.att..com like any prince." Psalm 82:6-7 [There's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to whether you're speaking of tradition in Paul's time or ours. I think there are two ways to use tradition. One is to say that when Paul and his readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition. That's what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly. We know that Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex. Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background. The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with that background. Even if the words in the sin lists aren't the most general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there's some evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of homosexuality. But when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that's rather a horse of a different color. The Catholic position involves a continuing church tradition. Arguments specific to that tradition might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul's original meaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted him, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours. I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition. A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent. tradition to illuminate Paul's original meaning, but not use the Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be.	15
: Ok, a few days back, the below-included message was posted stating: : : > I believe with everything in my heart that on May 3, 1993, the city of : >Portland, Oregon in the country of the United States of America will be hit : >with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake... : : By now, we know that this did not come to pass.... : : ...I don't think it's particularly : glorifying to God to say things like "Well, I THINK the Lord is telling me...", : ..Such statements seem to me to be an attempt to get a spiritual thrill should : the guess happen to come true, without risking the guilt of false prophecy : should it fail to come to pass. I do not believe genuine prophecy was ever : like this. Comments? : I agree. People should not be misled to believe "thus sayeth the Lord" by innuendo or opinion or speculation. Speak directly. If the Lord has given you something to say, say it. But, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", I'd better know for certain without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers. Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous. For me, my greatest fears in this area would be the following: 1--that the people would be misled 2--that people would lose respect for christianity 3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies 4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word, my calling would be lost forever. God's Word would command the people never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet. My bridges would be burnt forever. Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but I could never again be a prophet of God. In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate, cowardly silence or by our false statements. And because of this, it is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference. In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that do indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of this world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good. It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood. When we say, "thus sayeth the Lord", it happens. When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right. When we say we're christians, we really mean it.

The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure, a nun of the sisters of Charity on July 18, 1830 at Rue du Bac, Paris. Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy, age 5 or 6, who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light. The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her. Our Lady appeared to her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining to her life and to the future of France and the world. On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed her to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would receive great graces. In less than a year there were three more apparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports were received by those who wore it. Within two years of its issuing the medal was known as the "Miraculous Medal". Catherine died in 1876. Her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). She was canonized on July 27, 1947. Her body lies in the chapel at the motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with Our Lady. The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor. Above the altar, a pyramid painted to represent God's all knowing wisdom looked down on them. Our Lady's feet rested on a white globe and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was stepping on. In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world. Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed Catherine an image of two hearts, the Sacred Heart wrapped in piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. The sword represented her suffering with Jesus. The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned that a dark era lay in the immediate future. It was the apparition leading up to the recent ones. Our Lady began to dispense secrets. And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute with the forces of the dark. She told Catherine "The times are evil. Misfortunes will fall upon France. The throne will be overturned. The entire world will be overcome by evils of all kinds." Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady's messages. A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores. I will post other Marian events every few days or so including the ones happening today which are still under investigation. These postings serve only to introduce you to these events. Please look more into them and understand the reason for the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions. --	15
That's the whole point, David. As spirits separated from their bodies and living in the spirit world, they cannot undergo the ordinance of marriage, just as they cannot be baptized, since there is no physical body to be baptized. We perform these ordinances as proxies for them, in their behalf. Thanks for asking.

Without quoting at length from the preceeding post, I'd just like to say that I find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with issues like the Holocaust and Bosnia that asserting that "God is punishing them." The activity of God is always _redemptive_, which means "restoring what has been lost, broken, or distorted." So, God does not _will_ the brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but is nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend, and redeeem.	15
Well, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a similar question. I hope it helps: [Begin repeat of previous post] As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a problem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general. Luke's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven. It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation. (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.) I think the accounts are not as clear as they might be. Let's have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means. The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30, Mark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36. What happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, thought they could trap Jesus. They made reference to the "Leverite" marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children. The children would be considered children of the deceased, just as though the woman's first husband had fathered them. It seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband. However, the Sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow. They seem to imply that the Leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask, "Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection?" At this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody's wife, it is the first husband. After all, had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father. It is possible Jesus was refering to this when he says, "Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures or the power of God." (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24, phrase not in Luke's account). Anyway, the Sadducees ask, "Whose wife will she be in the resurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?" Jesus answer is that, "In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage..." (Mat 22:30) "When they rise from the dead they neither marry..." (Mark 12:25) "They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry..." (Luke 20:35) All 3 accounts go on to say, "but are as the angels in heaven" or the equivalent. I find this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like. (Some ministers claim that they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no Biblical support for this.)	15
Jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the Catholic Church. The dogma of the Assumption in no way means Mary is considered to be God or part of "the Godhead." Therefore it implies no such thing about the feminine in general. Also Jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was announced "out of the blue." This also is incorrect, as dogma is only the formulation of what has always been part of Tradition. This dogma has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the Assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.	15
... Thanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen previously. The part I quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient; I would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable. I would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death (perhaps this is the Old Testament interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that I would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a New Testament interpretation?). It is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non-violent provisions do not. I don't believe it does, and I would certainly observe that in the USA, where you have the death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in the UK, where we do not.	15
: Consequently, : this verse indicates that she was without sin. Also, as was observed at : the very top of this post, Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the : mother of Jesus, who was definitely without sin. If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to God, then why didn't Mary's mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus? For that matter, why didn't Mary's grandmother have to be without sin either? Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person, the need for the last one (Mary) to have none puts God in a box, where we say that He couldn't have incarnated Himself through a normal human being. My God is an all powerful God, Who can do whatever suits His purpose. This includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age; providing a path through the Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction; and the birth of Himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original sin. I see far too much focus on the "objects" of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the Author of our existence, without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to God in the form of Mary, Apostles and a Pope. : Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin, i.e. the : Immaculate Conception, is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned : during her lifetime, which is a separate doctrine and, I believe, also : held by the Catholic Church. If Mary was born without original sin, and didn't sin during her lifetime, how is she any different from Jesus? This means the world has had two perfect humans: one died to take away the sins of the world; the other gave birth to Him? I would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start praying to anyone other than God. Everything I have ever read from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless Lamb of God, not His mother, grandmother........ : Hope this is useful to you. Very useful in helping me understand some of the RC beliefs. Thank you.	15
Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the verse (or even chapter) numbers. I have always thought that such an edition would be very useful - although hard to navigate around. I have a Scots NT that doesn't show verse numbers, and it is great to read, particularly longer narrative passages, but my Scots isn't quite up to doing proper study from this edition - I tend to use it to get a "feel" for a story, particularly in the gospels, and then use an English edition to look for details.

searching out our deceased ancestors so that we can perform the ordinances -- such as baptism, confirmation, and marriage for time and eternity -- that are required for a person to obtain salvation through Christ and to live with Him through the eternities. These are people who may have not had the opportunity to know Christ in their lifetime, so we are making it possible for Christ's saving grace (I know there are thousands of interpretations of that phrase) to become fully effective for them if they allow it to do so on the other side. This paragraph brought to mind a question. How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Hammerslag (dhammers@urbana.mcd.mot.com) "...there ain't nobody so bad that the Lord can't save 'em ain't nobody so good they don't need God's love..." -- Mullins	15
You should remember that in Adam's transgression, all men and women sinned, as Paul wrote. All of humanity cooperativley reblled against God in Adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is transmitted from generation to generation. Andy Byler]	15
That is an assumption on your part. Where is your proof that one always will degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin. I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America. It is true that many individuals hated the proponents of racism. It is also true that many individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it. Dr. King's message was this. Love the individual, the loving of the individual would transform him into a friend. However, this did not take away his hatred for segregation. His hatred for injustice. I would ask, "Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish Leaders of his day?" Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple? We must have at least a distase for sin. We must in order to fight it in ourselves. Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its right name. Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name. It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth. -- "Competition is the law of the jungle. Cooperation is the law of civilization." -- Eldridge Cleaver	15
The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth. Jesus' words seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection. This being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now. Other- wise, why would Jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage? We do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall, and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant. Or at least, that's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of marriages performed on earth. Your mileage may vary. :)	15
After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with Liberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests. Someone might think to change the name to: soc.religion.any - or - perhaps even soc.religion.new. It might seem to be more appropriate. Heck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted for Bill Clinton. I'm on your side!	15

Please email me if you would like to have me send them to you (warning, about 70k worth of material. Make sure you have mailbox and/or disk space available.) There are no short answers to the questions we've been seeing here ("how do you explain these verses?", "How do you justify your actions?")

What is the proper way to dispose of old blessed palms? I`ve have a bunch that I`ve been holding onto. In addition, my mom has been giving me her's. I used to give them to my uncle who would burn them (and leave the ashes to seep into the ground). Should I do the same? Could I just bury them? Could I add them to my compost bin? Thanks in advance.	15
In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have given the impression that even though children didn't require baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were. To the contrary, when you baptize children before they are capable of comprehending it you deny them their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve God. Have any of you considered that children are not accountable for sin because they are not capable of repentance? Peter said to a group of "men and brethren," "Repent and be baptized every one of you" (Acts 2:38). Notice that he specified that if they *repent* then they may be *baptized*. In following Peter's instructions people must first demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and a desire to obey God's commands) *before* they are eligible to be baptized. Since young children are not capable of repenting, they are not eligible for baptism. And since God is both just and merciful "sin is not imputed when there is no law" (Romans 5:13), young children are not accountable for what they can't comprehend.	15

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort. She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so. For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any. One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking. So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?". Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest. The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?". Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims. At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing.)	15
Note that "scientific evidence" in this area does not prove any conclusions. There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little. Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the "scientific evidence" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain genetic problems. Even if they did have scientific evidence, I doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy Spirit that these things are sinful. This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine. He said something very true. Christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination. Most people do give in to their leanings. In Christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh, and bringing it into submission. One person may have a problem with his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed. But God offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers. The preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates with him. Is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband? The Bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal morality as it relates to humans.	15

It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland (also a Presbyterian church) managed to "agree to disagree" over women's ordination for 25 years. The reasoning was that congregations are free to call whoever they wish, and that Ministers and Sessions choose elders. If a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they were not obliged to, and if a Session did not wish to, they could not be forced to. (Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th Annivarsary of the Disruption, where the church split on that very issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years). A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained. In theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session, or refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery, could be disciplined. In practice this has not happened, and I believe it is unlikely to happen. My personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation worked very well. We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly. At this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of same-sex couples (after an Edinburgh minister did so). Our Panel on Doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year - the matter will be considered and debated then. Hope this is interesting	15
: When Elizabeth greeted Mary, Elizabeth said something to the effect that : Mary, out of all women, was blessed. If so, it appears that this : exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity. The phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women." There is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status, only that _as a woman_ Mary was blessed. Adding the word "all" is not a fair reading of the text. There are some good reasons for the church's veneration of Mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.	15

This sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff). It certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position. [Of course, I suppose that the medieval view of water may have been different, but now we know that the phases of water are just different *behaviors* of the same physical stuff - different modes, not different identities - but perhaps the medieval people did not know that]. This is clearly Modalistic Monarchianism, since these three aspects depend solely on point of view, and are do not really represent actual variety within the person. Do you now begin to see why	15
After reading this story about St. Maria Goretti (posted two weeks ago), I am a bit confused. While it is clear that her daily life is one of probity and sanctity, I am afraid I don't quite understand the final episode of her life. I am reading it correctly, she (and the Church apparently) felt that being raped was a sin on _her_ part, one so perfidious that she would rather die than commit it. If this is the case I'm afraid that I disagree rather strongly. Can anyone out there explain this one to me? Yours in Christ,	15
Before you finalize your file in the FAQs (or after), you might want to correct the typo in the following: It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with "homosexual". As a personal note, I guess I differ with you on the question of work entering human life as a result of sin. Before the fall (Gen 2:15) "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." which I would call "work". For me, the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added at the fall (I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the work for sustenance). In a way, some view "work" as a blessing (Ecclesiastes is a fun book! - for melancholies). I hope I do not sound caustic, maybe you can enlighten me further. Well, this is certainly a delicate subject, and I guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose "It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality", not for me the most noble goal, but you are writing a FAQ. I wonder if you might temporize the apparent "sentence" of the specific homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define). Perhaps that would be true of "celibacy from homosexual relations", or refrainng from their choice relationships, but that does not forbid heterosexual. Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations "for what it was worth"?	15
Sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, concerning the church's history. It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the church, and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage, and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I (414 AD). "At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to the extent of the canon, or the number of the books which should be acknowledged as divine and authoritative. The Jewish canon, or the Hebrew bible, was universally received, while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books suitable for church reading, and thus as a middle class between canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings. And justly; for those books, while they have great historical value, and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New, all originated after the cessation of prophecy, and the cannot be therefore regarded as inspired, nor are they ever cited by Christ or the aposteles." "In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed at the end of the fourth century through the authority of Jerome (who wavered, however, between critical doubts and the principle of tradition), and more especially of Augustine, who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint, and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic Epistles and the Revelation; though he himself, in some places, inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha as *deutero* canonical, bearing a subordinate authority." This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the Council of Hippo and of Carthage. It is interesting to note, however, the following footnote to the fourth session of the Council of Trent. The footnote lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical books, but then says "The Tridentine list or decree was the first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures." Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official until Trent. Thus my previous erroneous statement was not entirely groundless. It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent went on to uphold "the old Latin Vulgate Edition" of the Scriptures as authentic. Which, I would suppose, today's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said. Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical and canonical books--in contrast to (Eerdman's statement of) the fourth century views.	15
... I have seen it used in an Orthodox church once, although I can't recall why. I found it odd, to say the least. Also, I object to the statement that the Orthodox DELETE the filioque from the original form of the Creed. The creed originally did NOT contain that phrase, and it is not present in the Greek original, which hangs by my desk. Not intending to start a flame war. We didn't need to delete what wasn't there.

What is wrong with "the Spirit talking to Himself." Jesus intercedes for us, and Romans 8:26-27 tell of how the Spirit intercedes for us before God. That is no theological problem. Tounges as a prayer language finds support in I Corinthians 14:14-18. Its true that this could be (and has been) used as a rug to sweep any difficulties under. But it is a valid point. Paul does mention angelic tounges in the verse. If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel, then it stands to reason that angels would speak a different language from us. You do have a valid point about multiple angelic languages. But angelic beings maybe of different species so to speak. maybe different species communicate differently. I have heard an eyewitness account, myself. Such things are hard to prove. They don't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well. I don';t know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway. That's an unprovable statement. How can you prove if somethings been proved? There is no way to know that you've seen all the evidence. Once I saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer. John G. Lakes once prayed for someone and saw them healed in a laboratory, according to "Adventures in God." Its an interesting book.	15
I certainly agree with the last paragraph. Also, Jesus;s statements on hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as was much of his other teaching. There's more than enough hell here on earth that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter to me. And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift God offers. Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification. Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --	15
-= PASTORTALK =- A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day by Carl (Gene) Wilkes Startext: MC344578 CompuServe: 70423,600 Internet: 70423.600@compuserve.com -= THIS WEEK'S THOUGHTS =- Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an appeal by Rensselaer, IN, school officials desiring the distribution of Bibles in their public schools (REL65, 5/21). A lower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible- distribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The ACLU's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court's action protected the "religious neutrality of our public schools." He also said that schools must serve students of "all faiths and none." Schools were not to be a "bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts," according to Lynn. Several Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools. They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to continue their work at a distance, but find the school's position somewhat disheartening. I understand rationally and logically the court's position. And, I can see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other hand, when does "neutrality" become "nihilism?" When does plurality turn into no position at all? I see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment. The other is that while we are seeking "religious neutrality" in our schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced "religious neutrality" for the past seventy years--are making the Bible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St. Petersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had requested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents. I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin. Now, that's ironic! I admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths have equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid. However--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture's movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions. What do you think? -= MAIL BOX =- (Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your name.) Good column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree with moral education from home, but some homes don't have the kinds of morals I want taught. One family I worked with smoked dope as their primary family activity. Another acted like incest was OK. Families, no matter where they are, are often a lot sicker than we'd like to believe. From: John Hightower, MC 407602 John, I agree that the "home" ain't what it used to be, and some homes are NOT the place to learn value-based sexuality. I still believe that this is where the church can come into play. I know, those families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information, but the help does not need to be in a church building...I believe that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably disregard the value-free information at school, too.	15
As St. Augustine said, "I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy." (De nuptiis, lib. 11.c.12)]	15
[continuing with Dr. DeYoung's article-] SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D.S. Bailey D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai. He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who engage passively in such acts.*4 However, he insists that Paul knew nothing of "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion" (38). Hence Bailey limits the term's reference in Paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as "homosexuals." Bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in source]. Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt's translation "sodomites" best represents Paul's meaning in Bailey's judgment (39). Bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers. J. Boswell The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of John Boswell.*5 Whereas the usual translation*6 of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive sense. In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic evidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes." His argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity. Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male sexual person or male prostitute. He acknowledges, however, that most interpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make their bed with, men." Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting. He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes ("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such as paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance. His point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning. More directly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective (343). Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-. Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects. The Greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci; the corresponding passive would be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), Boswell affirms. He claims that arsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to Paul for a male prostitute," since by Paul's time the Attic words pornos ("fornicator") and porneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the LXX, had been adopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication."*7 In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus, Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of Paul" (346).*8 He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus Empiricus, and Libanius. He subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions of homosexual relation" (346)*9 among Christian sources in Greek, including the Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10 Clement of Alexandria, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom. Chrysostom is singled out for his omission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12 Cited are Tertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine. The last named uses "circumlocutions." Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius Felix. The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation. By the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife (353). Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every reason to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353). It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes. He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not disapprove of "gay inclination," "gay relationships," "enduring love between persons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism" (112, 166-17). ________________________________________________________ 4. D.S. Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London: 1975) 38. 5. J. Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago: 1980). 6. Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are: KJV, "them that defile themselves with mankind"; ASV, "Abusers of themselves with men"; NASB, "homosexuals"; RSV, NKJV, NRSV, "sodomites"; NEB, NIV, "perverts"; GNB, "sexual perverts"; In I COr 6:9 these occur: KJV, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; ASV, "Abusers of themselves with men"; NASB, RSV, "homosexuals"; NKJV, "sodomites"; NEB, "homosexual persversion." The RSV and NEB derive their translation from two Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as "homosexual perverts." NRSV has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and "sodomites" in the footnote. The active idea predominates among the commentators as well; it is the primary assumption. 7. Boswell, Christianity 344. Yet this was no a word "available to Paul for a male prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul (as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms). If Paul coined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion about its lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literature is meaningless. 8. Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word. 9. The key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for Boswell admits later (350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in the context. Hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer (Polycarp "To the Philippian 5:3"; Theophilus "Ad Autolycum 1.2, 2.14";Nilus "Epistularum libri quattuor 2.282"; Cyril of Alexandria "Homiliae diversae 14"; "Sybilline Oravle 2.13") meant. Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn the Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men should be pure. He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai from Paul's list. This at least makes Boswell's use of "all" subjective. Apparently Clement of Alexandria "Paedogogus 3.11"; Sromata 3.18"; also belong here. 10.. Yet Eusebius uses it in "Demonstraionis evangelicae 1." 11. Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom's use of arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1, or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when Chrysostom uses it. Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our study, whether in the lists or other discussions. Boswell later admits (351) that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on I Cor. Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai. 12. Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders arsenokoitai as "masculorum concubitores," corresponding "almost exactly to the Greek" (348 n.36). footnotes: _______________________ 5. D.S. Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London: 1975) 38. 6. J. Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago: 1980). Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are: KJV, "them that defile themselves with mankind"; ASV, "Abusers of themselves with men"; NASB, "homosexuals"; RSV, NKJV, NRSV, "sodomites"; NEB, NIV, "perverts"; GNB, "sexual perverts"; In I COr 6:9 these occur: KJV, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; ASV, "Abusers of themselves with men"; NASB, RSV, "homosexuals"; NKJV, "sodomites"; NEB, "homosexual persversion." The RSV and NEB derive their translation from two Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as "homosexual perverts." NRSV has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and "sodomites" in the footnote. The active idea predominates among the commentators as well; it is the primary assumption. 7. Boswell, Christianity 344. Yet this was no a word "available to Paul for a male prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul (as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms). If Paul coined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion about its lack of usage in contemporary non-Christian and Christian literature is meaningless. 8. Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word. 9. The key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for Boswell admits later (350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in the context. Hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer (Polycarp "To the Philippian 5:3"; Theophilus "Ad Autolycum 1.2, 2.14";Nilus "Epistularum libri quattuor 2.282"; Cyril of Alexandria "Homiliae diversae 14"; "Sybilline Oravle 2.13") meant. Yet Polycarp, who was a disiple of Hohn the Apostle and died about A.D. 155, argues in the context that young men should be pure. He uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai from Paul's list. This at least makes Boswell's use of "all" subjective. Apparently Clement of Alexandria "Paedogogus 3.11"; Sromata 3.18"; also belong here.	15
Interesting idea. Regular televeision seems to do this sort of thing too with politically correct shows.	15
Curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life recently. God's experience of time is so completely different from our own, since He is both within and without it. Using words like "foreknowledge" and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing God's perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and ending of our lives are all the same. Sort of. For God, there is no "before" when He did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or a time when he could have "predestined" our actions. In fact, since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with God's control of the universe.	15
Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace hears "prophesies" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship (or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter. That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here. --- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech---- Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh" If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether" With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations. -- ___ Bill Rea (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---	15
No. It is very relevant. Homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law. This is very important. Anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution (and I think you would agree that there is no proof for this.) If the Law reveals the character of God, and is "holy, just, and good" as is written in the New Testament, then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of Scripture. Why must we only discuss Scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships? Isn't that bordering on sophistry? The point we are making is that God did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts. Not everyone who brings up these Scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors. The issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly. I do not have problem with a loving, nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex. I have them, and we all do. The issue at hand is the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex, or lusting after. So other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation. And the idea that these relationships may be emotional relationships between adult humans is red herring. We all agree that it is okay for adults to have caring relationships with one another.	15

I find this remark to be awfully arrogant. I would venture to say that there are many people who are Christians now, who at one point in their lives had no intention of ever becoming a Christian. I was certainly one such person. I am quite thankful that there were Christians who were willing to continue to talk to me, despite the appearance that it might have been a waste of their time and mine. (I even married one of them.)	15
Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."	15
[ 2 good reasons deleted. AI] It's even worse than that -- "Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish from it" (Deut. 4:2). Shall we rip out every page from our Bibles beginning from Joshua through Revelation?	15
Let me say that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is central to Christianity. If you personally believe that Jesus Christ died for you, you are a part of the Christian body of believers. We are all still human. We don't know it all, but homosexual or heterosexual, we all strive to follow Jesus. The world is dying and needs to hear about Jesus Christ. Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel?	15

: Arrogance is arrogance. It is not the result of religion, it is the result : of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show : others of one's rightness. I assume that God decided to be judge for our : sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the : judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged : ourselves. I'm not sure I agree with this 100%. I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are. I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's superior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person's beliefs. I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views. If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive me. Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one's God is greater than the god's of others or of believing that one's religion is better than other religions. These are all naturally self-implied beliefs. It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong. Were I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be right. Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs correct. That's not arrogance. That's unavoidable behavior. It is nonsense to say that I believe another person's god to be greater than my God. Were his or her god greater, wouldn't I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God? We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the greatest. Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble? Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person. No doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile. Were passive observation of one's superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all. Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God's work of creation in our lives. People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another, "I'm not very smart. I'm poor. I'm not good looking. I'm just a worm in the ground. I'm such a weak person and although I don't want to sin, I really cannot help it." Were this person truely humble, he would take a different approach. "God, thank you for making me the way you did. I know that you never do anything second best. Yet with all that you have given me, I have been so unthankful. You've given me power to resist the devil. I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do. I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so. Lord, with all you've given me, I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness. And, yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save me. As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I've led. Lord, please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of insult. Lord I'm so sorry for my wrongs. Please help me to change." : : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they don't want to be wrong. If I find someone arrogant, I typically : don't have anything to do with them. For me, I've often found it hard to tell the difference. Often times, the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud "worm in the ground" false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company. When I'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don't feel like being confronted by my wrongness. Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness, I'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me. At the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I wish. However, were someone to confront me silently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private, I'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my ways. The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not. It isn't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one's ability to serve God. It's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God's creation in our lives instead. : But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions. For instance, : many of us feel "justified" to be insulted by an arrogant person. As if : we needed a reason to feel insulted. But after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others, you'd think we'd either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult. Just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn't make that : reaction the appropriate one. It is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions. : Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character. The devil is the accuser of the bretheren. He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong. The devil's aim is to get us into as much misery as he can. Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons. The way the devil gets under the Father's skin is by hurting those that the Father loves so much. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- "I deplore the horrible crime of child murder... We want prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of the evil... It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed... No mater what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed... but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime."	15
----- Begin Included Message ----- The following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith Ministries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of God. If you would like more info on the ministry, and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial, e-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com. LOVE IN THE MORNING (Psalm 90:14) by Malcolm Smith Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation before the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh, gateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than God's way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would have given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their decision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a sigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they were going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence. Whatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years. The only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation at Kadesh and had God' s promise of one day entering the land. The forty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those who were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over. All these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden. His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh. The problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. "Who is your God?" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young bull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt's gods as He led Israel to Sinai. But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow thin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the God of Almightiness becomes "ho-hum --What' s next on the miracle menu?" And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might be all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right to do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men's lives had hung on the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed God could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM and, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His acts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the day of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God. At Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He had seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This request was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's glorious Person. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and lovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word "lovingkindness" is not to be understood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the love that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Lovingkindness is as tenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on feelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and, therefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our highest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings of love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with us! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him to reject us. He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not because of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed to us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will not let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us-- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is saying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you." The God who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in His coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is lovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never leave us nor forsake us. Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as love; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing miracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the heart. Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power. Moses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for these people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out of knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who gives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to miss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force. If man is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from love demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the God of love. At this point, with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother's love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for, protected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were to ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?" or, "Have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?" Our questions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was conceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love's excitement, a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents' love is unconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally, spontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after His image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the Lord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents' love. It is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if it survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in the love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and gladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His love. "Satisfied." in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our deepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems disappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the emotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in religious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living God. Only in knowing God's love will the rest of life make sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it fascinating that he should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His love. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by the knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew better. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes and satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God to make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the love of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church, we read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers. This is an ancient expression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in Luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and "falling on his neck and kissing him." The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes. Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught us to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance and love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy Spirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to think on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded with the doctrine of "perform to be accepted." We begin to realize that He loves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge everyone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your eyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not feel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the other day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to Moses, "joy and gladness all our days." Joy is the result of a life that is functioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man' s highest performance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and, in joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.	15
The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian teaching concerning the death of Mary. Also very good is "Re: Question about the Virgin Mary" by Micheal D. Walker. He tells the story very well. I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate "The Dormition (or falling asleep) of the Theotokos (the mother of God)". The Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles who are weeping. Christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what seems to be a small child. This is, in fact, Mary's soul already with Christ in Heaven. The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death. It forshadows the general resurrection on the last day. The disciples were not surprised to find Mary's body missing from the grave. She was the Mother of the Savior. She was the first of all Christians. She gave birth to the Word of God. If it were not for her we would not be saved. This is why we pray in the Orthodox Church, "Through the prayers of the Theotokos, Savior save us."	15
I define faith as "belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence". I also include in "evidence" past experiences. Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s). From what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith. It is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word "faith") that I find intellectually dishonest. Pascal's wager goes something like this: Premise #1: Either there is or there isn't a God. Premise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing. Premise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn't matter because death is death, anyway. Conclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong. Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is, Premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have heard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of this is "what if I pick the wrong god?" Suddenly, the odds don't look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god's version of hell. I don't see how "disillusionment" enters into it. You see, I presented my mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a questioning which continues to this day. I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother's version of Christianity. If anything, I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism (uh, oh, I thought, What if there *is* a God?). Yes, in a way, I have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers, if I only found the right one. I'm still looking, but each time I look in a different place, I become a little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though, it's based on the evidence of past experience) that I'll never find a religion which has all the answers. Sorta like looking for Easter eggs. The more time it takes you to find the next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you're going to find. Someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any more highly of Christians. I have a contrary position: Constructive critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians. Abusive critisism will turn me off. No accusations to you, Mr. Sapienza. I merely slipped that into this post because I forgot to reply to that one. Muppets and Garlic Toast forever. Max (Bob) Muir	15
I didn't say to visit some "nice" homosexuals. I said "visit some congregations of Christians..spirit-filled believers.." Praise the Lord that we are all members of the same body. Let us agree to disagree.	15
I haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: 2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) : "Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.' He [David] said, 'While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.'" Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven (where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this applies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what would you say to this?	15
: However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no : way God or even part of God or equal to God. The Assumption of our : Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the : redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not : ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along : with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in : Heaven. Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to : any of the previously mentioned personages. As I said, it is a provocative thought. From "Answer to Job": The logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed and it leaves Protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a _man's religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman. ...Protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the signs of the times which point to the equality of women. But this equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a "divine" woman, the bride of Christ. Just as the person of Christ cannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re- placed by the Church. The feminine, like the masculine, demands an equally personal representation. The dogmatizing of the Assumption does not, however, according to the dogmatic view, mean that Mary has attained the status of a goddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is functionally on a par with Christ, the king and mediator. At any rate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype. [par. 753-4] : Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology. Jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology, not theology. His comments had to do with the psychological _image_ of God and its function in the human psyche, not about the actual existence or nature of God.	15
Has anyone read this important book? If so, what are your feelings about it? Frank	15
Gaining entry into heaven cannot be done without first being cleansed by the blood of Jesus. Sin cannot dwell in heaven. It is against the natural laws of God. Being converted to christianity means being baptized by the Holy Spirit. You cannot get to heaven by good works only. Because of the union with the holy spirit, the man's behavior will change. If there is true union he will not desire to be homosexual. Fornication and homosexuality will leave your life if you are truly baptized by the holy spirit. It's not to say that we don't stumble now and then.	15
Let me salute Gary Chin for speaking the gospel which is our source of life. Any who will follow his example, and accept the priorities Christ commands of us, that the weightier matters of the law are justice and mercy and good faith, is my brother or sister in Christ, and I will attend to such a person with humility and charity. We may not, in the end, agree -- siblings often don't -- but we can at least talk.	15
Either A: God exists, or B: He doesn't. We have two choices, either 1: Believe in God, or 2: Don't believe in God. If A is true, then 2 brings eternal damnation, whereas 1 brings eternal life. If B is true, then 1 has minor inconvenience compared with 2. Thus, it is rational to believe in God. This has numerous flaws, covered in the FAQ for alt.atheism, amongst other places. Disillusionment strikes me as an excellent reason for stopping believing in something.	15
This is not at all comparable. Christianity is the main stream in western culture. You are trivializing the experiences of others. I remember what it was like being "different" as a Christian. We were told all the time that we were different, and in fact that only members of the our church were really Christians (though others who believed in God weren't as bad as atheists), so we were a small minority. That was nothing compared to being an atheist. The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian being surrounded by staunch atheists, including parents, who actively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments and, even worse, emotional blackmail. They would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side. Maybe these conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a country with "under God" in its pledge of allegiance. * I doubt it even then, because children have to be taught to be Christians and hence must have support somewhere. Yes. My atheism was "born of necessity." For an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to evidence. Will or wishes have nothing to do with it. I could choose to lie, or to be silent about my true beliefs. I could no more choose to believe in the God of Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to me. Still I should be clear that I'm not equating what I went through with what gays go through. However it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them. Happily some are made stronger, once we get past it. Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood friends. Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally, and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even, or especially, on those who don't get free of it. I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and I feel no need to defend it. By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. In the end it has been, as someone eloquently put it in private email, an experience of liberation rather than disillusion.	15
You may not think that it is fair, but how many sins do you know of that affect only the sinner? Is it fair for us even to be able to get into Heaven? Do we have a _right_ to Heaven, even if we were to lead sinless lives? Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were God, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do things that way." Isaiah 55:8-9: "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." Original Sin is biblical: Romans 5:12-14: "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come." 1 Corinthians 15:22: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."	15
Like we have never heard of, or read these verses before? How about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and places in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals; what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with the rest of the Bible. There are many issues in the Bible that are argued, and can be argued successfullly from both sides of an issue. Some examples that come to mind are Gifts of the Spirit when the Rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation) how people should be baptized to name a few. I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love, even if we are the same sex. I'm sorry if I am coming across as heated. It's just that the Lord has been so dear to me the last several years and I'm tired of hearing this same old thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for themselves. Check it out for yourself. Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you. If I weren't confident of this I wouldn't invite you to do this.	15
That was my point. If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet anything I want. This is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature, not just out of a need to irritate. 8-) To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written, there is evidence of love, but that is a cultural bias. This is a poor answer which you needn't rebut. I will now pull the old bait and switch. I think you should use the Bible to judge man, not God. By that I mean, if your moral intuition doesn't like what is described in the Bible, realize that such things are going on now. I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it? Not you specifically, but everyone, including myself. If I don't like the genocide in the Bible, what about the genocide that goes on right now? To move beyond the question of a hell, realize that many people right now are suffering. If you think hell isn't fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence, what about how life isn't fair? Right now there is a young mother with three little kids who doesn't know how she will get through the day. Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie. Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his TV. Instead of why doesn't God help them ask why don't we help them. I think you are correct to challenge any Christian who doesn't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess. You want evidence of God. Find someone who is making a difference, someone you admire, someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head up. Ask the person how he does it. Ask the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. Ask the woman who was pregnant at 15, kept the baby and now is a successful business woman. Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound baby. They won't all be Christians, or even what you might call religious, but there will be something in common. God is not defined in the Bible, God is defined by what is in those people's hearts. It doesn't matter if you can't give intellectual assent to any description you've heard, they're all wrong anyway. The compassion you already feel in your heart is a step in the right direction. Follow that instead. Then come back and read the Bible and you'll see that same thing described there. Good, I guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8-)	15
Indeed, the immediate context [NASB] is: 26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. 27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this comes judgement; 28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him. The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context, the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's sacrifice, "once", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind. Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his "Christianity and Reincarnation". The thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death. The "once" is repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity of Christ's deed. One thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than once. But the comparison to the human experience - die once, then judgement (note: not "the judgement", but just "judgement". The word for judgement is "krisis". Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation. At this point, I would just emphasize again that the passages that (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably they are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of Hebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context, namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death. What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the Last Day. If you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable. And there are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc- tion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2. We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them. But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist and "new age" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular incarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ as the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences; the redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of the body, and the Last Judgement. Taken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective. E.g. the destiny of those who died in their sins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to works, the meaning of "deathbed conversion", the meaning of the sacraments, and many other things. Not that I propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and Redeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such as the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence. There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with. But Christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) could not bear yet. This idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole of humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process. The Bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the greater context, from Genesis to Revelation. Now, salvation (healing) becomes, not the end of man's sojourn but its beginning. And the Last Judgement and the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.	15
Fred Gilham asks (May 11) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Yes, he did. He did not publish it, but it will be published by the Oxford University Press in German and with English translation in Volume 3, due to appear this fall, of his Collected Works. Meanwhile, you can find a summary, or perhaps the whole thing, in an article by Jordan Howard Sobel called "Goedel's ontological proof" in the book ON BEING AND SAYING, edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson (sp?), published by the MIT Press in 1987. Professor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota has written an article, "Some Emendations of Goedel's Ontological Proof," which appeared in the magazine FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY, v. 7 (1990): 291-303. It discusses some objections that various critics have raised against Goedel's proof, and offers a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these objections.	15
I see no other way of interpreting them other than homosexuyality being wrong. Please tell me how these verses can be interpreted in any other way. I read them and the surrounding text.	15
David Hammerslag asked: How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)? Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed, but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less one of the following three positions: (1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa- tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they didn't believe in). These people -- and those associated with them ("Now there were with us seven brethren", Matt. 22:25) -- would not be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage. Hence, the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni- ties; but that doesn't mean other, more faithful people could not have this blessing. (2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married. The latter activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of before then. (3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is missing something that would make its real meaning clearer. Note that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph- ets. Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question was not significantly revised in the "Joseph Smith Translation" or "Inspired Version" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con- stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.	15
What is fornication? (sex outside of marriage, abuse of sex) Is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage? Isn't it an unatural use of what God has given us? Why is it that homosexuals are using the Grace of God as a license to practice sin? For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. Jude 4 (NASB) What is defined by God as a legitimate marriage? For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the shall become one flesh. Gen 2:24 (NASB) And He answer and said, "Have you not read, that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, and said, 'FOR THIS CAUSE A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER, AND CLEAVE TO HIS WIFE; AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." Matt 19:4-6 (NASB) But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. 1 Corinthians 7:4,5 (NASB) I disagree... Every law that is written in Leviticus should be looked at as sin. That is why we have a need for a savior. I can understand someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the Levitcal law, but I would hope that they would repent when confronted with it. Also I noticed that the preceeding verses say. Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity. And you shall not have intercourse with your neighbors wife, to be defiled with her. Leviticus 18:19, 20 (NASB) These verses are just as relevant as: You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination. Leviticus 18:22 (NASB) Why was God telling the Israelites not to practice such things? Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled. For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants. But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and Judgments, and shall not do any of these abominations, neither the native, nor the alien who sojourns among you Leviticus 18:24-26 (NASB) He is the Lord... Listen to what he has to say... Nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals. We do love you, but we don't agree that what you practice is not sin. You have not truly repented of your sin. We hate the sin that is within your lives. I hate sin that is in my life. All Christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives. Confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance. Yes I agree with John 3:17, but I also know that Jesus said, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" Matt 3:17. If you don't agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it? This means that you remain in bondage to it. Repent from it and God will set you free.

I wrote that I thought that 2 Peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of Scripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is merely the private opinion of the writer." Tony Zamora replies (Sat 8 May 1993) that this in turn implies that it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader either. I am not sure that I understand this. In one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation. If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians lost the Pelopennesian War, I cannot simply interpret this away because I wanted the Athenians to win. Facts are facts and do not go away because I want them to be otherwise. In another sense, every statement is subject to private interpretation, in that I have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent. Even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing, I still have to decide, using my own best judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. This is not arrogance -- it is just an inescapable fact.	15
And as someone mentioned earlier, from the apocryphal Book of Enoch, satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will, "I will". Hmmm...pro-choice looks kinda creepy here.	15
Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception: + I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and + between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall + crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel. + -Genesis 3.15 + He who commits sin is of the devil ... -1 John 3.8 + Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with + thee ... -Luke 1.28 In the Hebrew of Genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine. + HE shall crush your head, and you shall bruise HIS heel. The Latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar. Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just "full of grace" but "having a plenitude or perfection of grace." The word is used elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 1:6 + Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath + GRACED us in his beloved Son. (Rheims-Douay translation) I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies anything as strong as Andrew suggests, nor does the Ephesians passage suggest that the verb means "to preserve from any taint of original or actual sin from the first moment of existence." I should like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb, preferably not from s writer who is discussing Luke 1:28 at the moment.	15
Until recently I always understood the term "kingdom theology" to mean the theology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a new and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called "Dominion theology", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again. I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told that it is a very widespread belief in the USA. Can anyone give me any more information about it? Here are some of my questions: 1. Is it the teaching of any particular denomination? If so, which? 2. Where and when does it start? 3. Are there any particular publications that propagate it? 4. Are there any organizations that propagate it?	15
When I need a kick-butt God, or when I need assurance of the reality of truth, I pray to God the Father. When I need a friend, someone to put his arm around me and cry with me, I pray to Jesus. When I need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation, I pray for the Holy Spirit. I realize that the above will probably make some people cringe, but what can I say? I think the doctrine of the trinity is an attempt to reconcile Jesus being God and being distinct from God, as described in the Bible. I wonder if Jesus had been a Hindu how different the wording would be.	15
Do we attach some meaning of the Israelites entering "the promised land" to Christianity? I submit God did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over Joshua and Caleb. This is recorded for us in Deuteronomy 1:39 "Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it." At least to me it seems there was/is an age, or point in maturity where they were/are held responsible, and could not enter the "Promised Land", younger ones were not held to the same "rules", at least not by God.	15
hey folks, I'm fairly new to these groups, tho' some have heard from me before. I'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot: What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents? In normal dreams, you can't control anything, so obviously you aren't morally responsible for your actions. But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies. Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives: 1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena. In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts. 2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane') Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person. A mark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience. In this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life. 3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe different) moral laws apply there. So... There it is. Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know of another alternative? respond by post or email. thanks very much *dt* ========================================================	15
Absolutely not. I went through a "journey" of lukewarm Christianity, agnosticism, atheism, agnosticism, and now (although I know my faith is less than what it should be) Christianity again. I think it's a path many of us take.	15
Michael> The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is Michael> that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket Michael> equation of homosexual behavior and rape. Since Christians Michael> citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have Michael> at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge Michael> that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us. and Michael> It is just Michael> as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a Michael> secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate Michael> homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the Michael> rape of God's messengers. Let's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly. It states clearly that the visitors were angels. But "all the men from every part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house. They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.' " For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of Sodom and by Lot as *men*. Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21 that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before the angels visited the city. It is clear that the grievous sin of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex. It appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square--which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity. It does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us believe. Ultimately our understanding of God's will for sexuality comes from the creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. He created us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female, "Therefore a man will leave his father and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh." This marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church. But we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men, or between two women. Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from or expresses God's will in instituting and blessing marriage. Thus the Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest, homosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor's wife; other commandments forbade rape. The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage relationship. Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural', Romans 1:26,27--not because this was simply Paul's opinion, but because it was contrary to God's purpose in creating us male and female. Michael> Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here Michael> and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they Michael> ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously Michael> have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL Michael> ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest Michael> charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can Michael> manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they Michael> suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss Michael> our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what Michael> it is. Really, have you no better response to `slander' than more slander?	15

This may sound argumentative, but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships? If we do a little substitution above, we get: "although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous men and women, there certainly is a fairly larget percentage (in my experience) who are. I am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship. This in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the Incest association of his community..." Do the same standards apply? If not, why not? And while we're in the ballpark, what about bestiality? I can't recall offhand if there are any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals; does that activity have more or less a sanction? Please avoid responses such as "you're taking this to extremes". I would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at large views incest. -- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Scott Cokely | (714) 833-4760 scott.cokely@nb.rockwell.com "They came for the Davidians, but I did not speak up because I was not a Davidian.

That doesn't mean that the same people would accept those substitutions. The question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent Christ's relationship to humanity. This is at least *partly* an empirical question. In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble. I think that's the case with slavery. One can argue that in theory, if you follow Paul's guidelines, it's possible to have Christian slaveholders. But in practice, over a period of time, most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it. The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality. (Note: Christian homosexuals, not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda). You may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation, but I would argue that it's at least relevant. You can't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't look at the Incest association, because in fact there is no such association. If there were, it might be reasonable for you to look at it too. Of course that doesn't mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way. Part of why there aren't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results.	15
My girlfriend is a smoker. She has been addicted to it for quite some time. She has been tried a couple of times, but then always get back to it. Her background is non-Christian, but she's interested in Christianity. I'm a Christian and non-smoker. I would like to collect any personal stories from Christians who managed to quit. I hope that this will encourage her to keep on trying. If anybody ever had a similar problem or knows a good book on it, pls reply by email. I appreciate any kinds of helps. Thanks a lot.	15
My sentiments exactly... which is why I'm unsubbing from this group. This is the 3rd 'christian' discussion list I have ever belonged to and once again I'm being chased away by the strife, anger, discontent, lies, et al . As Paul (Saul) said, 'I come to preach Christ, and Him crucified' Don't let the simple beauty of faith in God get overshadowed by heady theological discussions or thousands of lines of post-incarnation trappings of some church. As for the atheists/agnostics who read this list: if you aren't christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian discussion list ? I will continue to search for christian discussion (prayerful, spirit-filled, kind, humble, patient, etc.) in other circles. -- Sheila Patterson, CIT CR-Technical Support Group 315 CCC - Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 (607) 255-5388	15
Romans 10:16-17 "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?' Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ." So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel. Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached. Kids are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to respond to God's word. Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life. Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies. They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby. This change in the baby's soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without Baptism. Since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant. But as the child gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play. Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." If you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn't hold us guilty for anyone else's sins. So we can have no original guilt from Adam. Adam was given a number of gifts by God. The chief among them was what Catholics call "sanctifying grace". (In the New Testament, the word used for this is "charity".) By his sin, Adam lost this grace. He didn't lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole human race. Because once he lost it, he couldn't pass it on to his descendents. That's why Catholics baptize babies. Through his Original Sin, Adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents. Christ instituted Baptism to give it back to everyone.	15

Have any of you read Harold Camping's book "1994?"? It's about biblical evidenc that points to September of 1994 as the probable time of Christ's second coming It's a very informative book and a must read for all Christians. You can get i at your local bookstore for only $14.95. Peace!	15
This is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. The ending of a 1600 year old schism seems to be in sight. The theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally ones or terminology, and that the Christological faith of both groups was the same. Some parishes have concelebrated the Eucharist, and here in Southern Africa we are running a joint theological training course for Coptic and Byzantine Orthodox. There are still several things to be sorted out, however. As far as the Copts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the Byzantine Orthodox acknowledge seven.	15
This is too often true. Many people try to place this as a "higher" sin. However... A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider (active) homosexuality a sin. I don't often see the attitude of "forgive me and I will try to change". Instead I see "there's nothing wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian, so it must be you who have an illness because you don't accept me". Christians can and will accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner. Sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin! I was born with a desire to sin, but I work to prevent myself from sinning. It's much less common now, but I *still* have urges to lash out in anger. There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years.	15
I think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, or dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign that he has something sinful in his heart. It may be the Holy Spirit's way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it removed. Generally, if one has a pure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy even when he dreams. Dreams also can be from the Lord. Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord. Regarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be careful with. What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else. Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience. Some things that might be called an OOBE might actually be from the Lord. Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE. In II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught up into the third heaven. Is an OOBE truely an OOBE? Does one really leave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a spirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit? I don't think it matters that much. Paul could not tell. Be that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan to experience OOBE's. We should not meditate and pretend we are in a place until our spirits apparently float there. This is dangerous. If God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His own sovereign will. In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are just taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking an OOBE. John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was caught up in the visions he received. Ezekial was talking with some Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one time. If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it. People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits for the sake of a few thrills.	15
no I'd recommend reading _Mormonism and Early Christianity_ by Hugh Nibley, particularly the articles on Christ's forty-day (post-resurrection) mission, baptism for the dead, early Christian prayer circles, and temples (2 articles). ..bruce.. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Bruce F.

Lets talk about principles. If we accept that God sets the standards for what ought to be included in Scripture - then we can ask: 1. Is it authoritative? 2. Is it prophetic? 3. Is it authentic? 4. Is it dynamic? 5. Is it received, collected, read and used? On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling. But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place, and it wasn't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out. The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions. Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead body' that it was included in the catholic canon. How do you then view the words: "I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city" (Rev 22.18-9) Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions. It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus' attitude. He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture. I am not familiar with the book. Some other arguments you might like to consider are found in Chapter 3 of Josh McDowell's Evidence That Demands A Verdict.	15
I hate to sound flippant, having shot off my mouth badly on the net before, but I'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my feeling that "the assumption of Mary" would be better phrased "our assumptions _about_ Mary." In all the time I've been reading about Mary on this group, I can not recall reading much about Mary that did not sound like wishful veneration with scant, if any, Scriptural foundation. I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christ's parents as compellingly human persons; to be honored and admired for their humility and submission to God's working, beyond doubt. But the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures, untouched by sin or human desire. Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified, and even He knew temptation, albeit without submitting to it. I also don't see the _necessity_ of saying the Holy Parents were some- how sanctified beyond normal humanity: it sounds like our own inability to grasp the immensity of God's grace in being incarnated through an or- dinary human being. I won't start yelling about how people are "worshipping" Mary, etc., since folks have told me otherwise about that, but I do think we lose part of the wonder of God's Incarnation in Christ when we make his parents out to be sinless, sexless, deathless, otherworldly beings.	15
Hello, Brycen ?! I'm a Norwegian journalist student - and also a Christian. Thanks for your testimony! But I want to ask you one question: What do you think of Heavy Metal music after you became a Christian? You know there are Christian bands like Barren Cross, Whitecross, Bloodgood and Stryper, that play that kind of music. I like some of it, I feel like it sometimes. Of course I listen to the lyrics too. I don't listen to any Christian band, but it's better than listening to secular music anyway. Hope you're still going strong - with Christ!!	15
That depends on how this verse is read. There are at least two meanings of the word "once". 1) only one time, and 2) at some other time (i.e. once upon a time). Note that in the previous verse, the word "once" is used with the second meaning, and also in the following verse, "once" is again used with the second meaning. The Greek, I am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings for the English word "once". I am not a Greek scholar, but I'm sure someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning. If the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as: - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with Adam), but after this [gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ] the judgement [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life with Christ.	15
I don't agree, but I can only speak for myself. I have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful. Do I hate the things she does to herself and others? Yes. Do I hate her? Absolutely not. In fact, she tells me repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world. I care about her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life. It's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above. I've felt it with my friend more than once. There is a very important part of Christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible to "love the sin but hate the sinner." Before I look at someone else's life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see in *me* as I see in others, probably more. Self-righteousness is contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen. If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, "Wretched man that I am!" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin. If we have the attitude of the Pharisee who said, "I thank Thee that I am not like other men..." [Luke 18:11 (NASB)], we will hate both. -- Scott at Brandeis	15
I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out! When you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would "righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is really "best" for them. You cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the context of the teachings of Jesus/God. I think he advocated a different approach that was *by design* made to be appealing, to those called by him, not chosen by a church practice. It seems to me you have the cause and effect switched, the change comes and then you get baptized.	15

[I'm going to cut "Rex"'s ramblings down a bit.] [...] Rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree Masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. If nasty stuff was really going on, don't you think you'd have more than a couple of disgruntled members "exposing" it? Heck, if what you say is true, then Rev. Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper. [... Long quote from someone named Hislop (source not given) deleted. I'm attempting to extract from it the relevent points: * Osiris is actually Nimrod, a Babylonian Deity. * "It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris." * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building trade, ie, with Masonry. * Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. [isn't this refering to a Biblical Nimrod, rather than the Babylonian god?] * ...there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'. ...] There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. This dates right back to the Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. I've seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and Egyptians, and Atlanteans. I even have a book which claims to prove that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple. Claims prove nothing. Where's the beef, Rex? [...Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge] I'd have to check this. The tomb paintings I remember don't show this. Can you give ancient citations for this? The druids were suppressed over 2000 years ago. What's your point? This whole "leopard skin" business sounds bizarre. I have not yet gone through the Scottish Rite (which contains all of those "higher degrees" anti-Masons get so excited about, and which was invented in the 1750's), but I know enough people who have (and who are good Christians), that I reject your claim. Not so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu'. I'm going through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american. Why don't you try reading some serious books on Masonic history, such as Hamill's "The Craft"? Because we got honest. If you can come up with actual evidence that Masonry existed prior to 1390, I'd be VERY impressed (actually, anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.) Peter Trei ptrei@mitre.org	15

Fred Gilham asks whether it is true that Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God. Yes, it is true. Someone has published a rebuttal pointing out certain flaws in the argument, and recently Professor C Anthony Anderson, of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in the original version. He has sent me a copy, which I still have (I saw it last week when I was looking for something else), and when it surfaces again I can supply particulars. My guess is that it is being published (or already has been) in the Journal of Symbolic Logic.	15
: I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where : Christians were called to "repent" of America's "national" sins, such : as sexual promiscuity. : : To which I reply: ...whoa there! : : How can I repent of _someone else's_ sin? I can't. : : And when I claim to "repent" of someone else's sin, am I not in fact : _judging_ him? Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us : not to judge people. "Judge not that ye be not judged." : : C. S. Lewis made the same point in an essay after World War II, : when some Christian leaders in Britain were urging "national repentance" : for the horrors (sins???) of World War II. : -- I see your point, but I cannot more strongly disagree. To repent means to turn around. We, as a nation, have behaved incredibly arrogantly toward God condoning, encouraging, and even forcing folks to participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God. We have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed us the luxury of living in this land. We have set a bad example for other nations. We've slaughtered unborn children by the millions. We have stricken the name of God from the classroom. We've cheated God out of the honor due Him at every turn, and we owe God an apology every bit as public as our sins have been. When Jesus said "Judge not that ye be not judged", he was not addressing those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to repent. He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down condemnation on others for their sins. His message to us all was to remove the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother's. But He also said to rebuke and to reprove. Don't forget that this is a command too. Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the excuse that we don't want to judge anyone. In truth, what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives. Call sin what it is and do so openly. Let it's charge fall correctly where it should. But instead of running someone into hell over it, pull them out of their hellward path and onto the heavenward path. -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- "I deplore the horrible crime of child murder... We want prevention, not merely punishment. We must reach the root of the evil... It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed...

Hello. Hoping to net some netters who are in the helping professions (counseling, psychology, psychiatry, social work, therapy etc.) to network on some topics and consider the possibility of a sci.counseling.christian type newsgroup or list.

Email me direct if you will so we can get to know one another off the news.	15
But one of the most basic concepts of Christian morality is that we all have defective appetites due to original sin. Not just homosexuals, but everybody. Thus we are not entitled to indulge in whatever behavior our bodies want us to. I think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual _behavior_ (which is wrong) and homosexual _orientation_ (which is not a sin, merely a misfortune). [Please: NO EMAIL REPLIES.

Hi Bruce. How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18? Ezekiel 18:20 "The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him." Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps? Sincerely, Aaron Cardenas P.S. I too am bothered to see offensive words being posted on this newsgroup. Obscenity is out of place for anyone who wants to live by the Bible (Eph 5:4). Moderator: I would appreciate your not letting posts with foul language through, which has happened at least twice lately. Thank you.	15
This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the "Johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of Taize (pronounced te-zay) in France. NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP: ========================== soc.religion.taize (Unmoderated) PURPOSE OF THE GROUP: ==================== The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in France. Many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly "Johannine Hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each month. A "Johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given Bible passage, followed by some questions for reflection. Any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less in polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own life-journey. The idea of "Johannine hours" was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible's message in the midst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence, we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ. During the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply. Perhaps those who read and think about the "Johannine Hours" in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others. The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network. BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY: ================================= The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community. "A PARABLE OF COMMUNION": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of World War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal refugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation. AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize's founder spent the first two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949, seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation. Today, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North and South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no capital. The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize. TAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and less young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental meetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too small. "A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH" The community has never wanted to create a "movement" around itself. Instead, people are called to commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood, their city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". At the end of each year, the pilgrimage has a "European meeting" which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year. NOTE: Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news.groups. For any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk brother.roy@almac.co.uk	15
Hi everyone, I'm trying to find my way to God, but find it difficult as I can't hear God talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me, and I feel that I can't possibly get to know him until he does. Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just don't know or understand how to listen. Some Christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover. This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening, but I have a few questions. 1) How do you actually commit yourself? If I just say, "OK God, her you go, I'm committing my life to you", I wouldn't really feel that he'd listened - at least, I couldn't be sure that he had. So how does one (or how did you) commit oneself to God? 2) In committing myself in this way, what do I have to forfeit of my current life? What can I no longer do? I feel that I'm as 'good' as many Christians, and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - I don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians. So what do I have to give up? 3) When committed, what do I have to do? What does it involve? What (if any) burdens am I taking on? 4) So then, what's the general difference before and after? I assume, that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it won't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself. So what happens? 5) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do? How can I find out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?! Thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. Perhaps e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.	15
[...] That brings up an interesting question. If this interpretation is correct, how would these people be getting into Heaven before Jesus opened the gates of Heaven?	15

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort. She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so. For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any. One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking. So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?". Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest. The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?". Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims. At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing.)	15
I have not seen this book, though I have had several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertions they were making, so I have become curious about it. I don't want to malign this Hislop fellow, whoever he may be, as I have only heard the arguments at second hand, but both of the arguments seemed to turn on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop. I would be interested in knowing more about these things. The first one claimed that the word "church" was derived from the Greek "cyclos", and that it was therefore related to the worship of "Circe". I don't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion, but it does seem to be based on false etymology. The second claimed an etymological relationship between "Ishtar" and "Easter", which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some of the wilder notions of the British Israelites. Regarding the latter, as far as I have been able to find out, "Easter" is derived from the old English name for April - "Eosturmonath". The Venerable Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called "Eostre", but apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more about her. It also seems that the term "Easter" is only used by the English and those they evangelized. The Germans, for example, also use the term "Ostern", but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries. So I would be interested in any evidence of "Easter" being used for Pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo- Saxons and their offshoots. Such evidence might support the claims of those who appear to derive the theory from Hislop.	15
Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity, innocence and modesty, and their importance. The Most Beautiful Virtues This story is an excerpt taken from The Basket of Flowers by Johann Christoph von Schmid In a certain little market town, over a hundred years ago, there lived an upright and intelligent man named Jacob Rede. He was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val- ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob's wife died, leaving him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in years, her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness, that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel. Mary's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour- ite flowers were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender. When she once, early in March brought the first violet to Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil- ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to bloom in retired grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain- ing hidden beneath the leaves. May you also, my dear Mary, be like the retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to attract the public eye, but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace. One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter, as he pointed out a beautiful lily, which was beaming in the morning sun: Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi- test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals: they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the hardest -5- to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily soiled; touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind. In the same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence! Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty. More beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is still pure of heart and innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to blush, as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger. The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue, while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan, and go before their time to the grave." Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in the middle of the garden. Mary's father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance. The tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called to her father Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling of red and white? The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers! The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more upon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were all become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary wept bitter tears at the sight. Then said the father: Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth. Oh my child, never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right! Behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way - if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart should vanish, not merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah, then how much more bitter would be the tears which I would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes I should -6- go down sorrowfully to my grave. As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply moved, and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them. Under the eyes of a father so loving and wise, and amid the flowers of her garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli- gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a lily and retiring as a violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom. Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil; but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example. Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together in a bunch and gave them to Mary with the words: The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one to the other; both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren- dered still more lovely by being together. In the same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and cannot be separated The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought of the presence of God	15
jwindley@cheap.cs.utah.edu (Jay Windley) writes... [...] This is curious. I read in _EH_... "The Lord imparted the gift of knowledge to James the Just, to John and Peter after his resurrection, these delivered it to the rest of the apostles, and they to the seventy, of whom Barnabas was one." --- Eusebius, _Ecclesiastical History_ It seems that the Lord imparted the gift of knowledge, not that the Lord imparted secret information. [...] I'm afraid that I cannot find this portrayal in _EH_. I don't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain gnostics had the wrong gnosis. The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus' statements, "...whilst if there were any at all, that attempted to pervert the sound doctrine of the saving gospel, they were yet skulking in dark retreats..." "Favorably interpreted?" Just in looking at two of the four references that you gave (I have the _EH_ handy, Irenaeus and the _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for) I see no room for such 'interpretations.' And any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to the Temple Ceremonies. The links for Jay's using _EH_ for support are: "imparting the gift of knowledge" = "imparted secret information" = "being given secret signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven." But there is not enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call this "favorable interpretation." It appears to be closer to "fabrication."	15
Thanks for the responses so far. I hope that I have sparked some thought (which is more my intent than to restart one of the Reformations). I'm just going to tug on two threads: In Message-ID: <May.10.05.07.21.1993.3479@athos.rutgers.edu> db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) writes, I was simply observing that as a non-Jew, I am not in that community which might be bound by such a decision (I don't know much about the Council of Jamnia, but I have heard that it is not well-attested historically). 'Faithless' has nothing to do with it, and I prefer not to speculate about motives. I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real dialogue,, but I think it a fictional effect on Justin's part. Putting that to one side, Justin's point may be evidential; one would want to know- 'which books?' Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (MS evidence) they had. Let's stick to the issues. Again, I prefer not to speculate about motives. One would need quotes from Luther, Calvin, etc. to evidence this 'preference'. ----- In Message-ID: <May.9.05.38.22.1993.27327@athos.rutgers.edu> wagner@grace.math.uh.edu (David Wagner) Is this the principle: 'Any (BC) text not quoted by Christ cannot be counted as Scripture' ? Think well about this- Job, Ruth...? These is a logically invalid *a priori*. Besides, we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT (in the Xtian view). Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_? This principle cannot be consistently applied. Dave W. answers: Meaning what? Do you affirm the principle (that the D.c's can be excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it? If affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine that doctrine X is false? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_? If so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. The Orthodox faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical. How can my faith say 'Not!' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned before. This is contrary to fact. Can this be elevated to a principle? How is 'spiritual quality' measured? I'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of Sirach over Joshua or Chronicles, any day. What can I say? You believe what you believe- I'm asking for a consistency check. I don't see that the books were added- in any construction this formulation begs the question. No one can validly ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical. Dave Davis, ddavis@ma30.bull.com These are my opinions & activities alone QOTD:	15
> Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended > with the death of St John, the last Apostle. Nothing new can be > added. Every so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is now in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church. It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such declarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities: 1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death of (for example) Joan of Arc. 2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John which had Joan's name on it. 3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or even that she is a historical character.	15
EXACTLY!! Read that one sentence in there..."to the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred..." I don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep the peace; the Church in the United States feels the same way, thus the reason that the Catholic Church has opposed every execution in this country in recent memory. So what is justifiable? As you stated very explicitly from the new Catechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep the peace. Since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be opposed to *any* form of capital punishment in America.	15
My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason. He let me look at some of the books (which after his death his "brothers" came over and took from his greiving widow before his body had even cooled). Don't tell me you don't worship Osiris. You must not be past your 20th level. You should read Wilkinson's Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British Masonry. There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason. I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide ("mystery"). Special handshakes and all. When he first started trying to "evangelize" me, he told me all kinds on special this, and special that. Here is truely a "mystery" religion. THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of. I haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same conclusion. "Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e. as a child in his mother's arems. THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none other than Nimrod. It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother, or wife of Osiris. But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building? Now, if such were the case, considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art? The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. He was the first that gained faim in this way. As the child of the Babylonian goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of Fortification.' Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.' THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod. I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the son of Cush, was a negro. Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......." Hislop It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin. I mean real leopard skin. He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin. (The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!) Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue." It is a universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves. Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard. It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or should I say hide, this representation. They, however, worshipped the "spotted cow". I'll stand by my statements. Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter, I do not mean to be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt. Of the Masons I have personally talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin. Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?	15
From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) 1] An english translation of this can be found in: "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson (London, 1923). 2] Another work that might be useful is: "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933; reprinted 1970). (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic. I don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966). 4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s. (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find. So if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible Society, 1971). Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT. It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3. Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts). "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an English translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). 6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version. The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian). The Western text seems to be given to more detail. There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy. If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.	15
Hi, What presentation package would you recommend for a Bible teacher? I've checked out Harwards Graphics for Windows. I think its more suitable for sales people than for preachers or Bible teachers to present an outline of a message. I'm looking for one that: * is great for overhead projector slides. * has or imports clip arts * works with Word for Windows or imports Word for Windows files. * works with inkjet printers If you know of any that meets part or all of the above, please let me know. Please email your response as I don't keep up with the newsgroup.	15
: After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it : has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with : Liberals, Catholics, New Agers', and Athiests. Someone might think : to change the name to: soc.religion.any - or - perhaps even : soc.religion.new. It might seem to be more appropriate. : Heck, don't flame me, I'm Catholic, gay, and I voted : for Bill Clinton. I'm on your side! Since when did conservative, protestant, old-time religion believers get an exclusive francise to christianity? Christianity is, and always has been, a diverse and contentious tradition, and this group reflects that diversity. I, fo one, am not ready to concede to _any_ group- be they "liberal" or "conservative", catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic or not- the right to claim that they have _the truth_, and everyone else is not "christian."	15
Hello. I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country. I am not sure if it is going on also here in the US or any other country. In all these 4 1/2 yrs. I've been here in Illinois, USA, I have not encountered it. May I just call it "Traveling Fatima" since I don't know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language. For certain regions in a district in a town or city, an image/ statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home (originating from owner) to another. This will stay with that family for one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our Lady of Fatima. The move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing' prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move. There will be the 'receiving' prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image there. It does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image. They may invite others (or others/friends can invite themselves in ;^)) to participate during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week. This image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district, until it goes back to the owner of the image. This is probably going on around there (Philippines) right now (or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot) and every year, this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima. It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image then is just moved next door. I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives. Most of our friends and neighbors there are Catholics and practicing ones. I'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this practice will violate, whatsoever, before I go for it. Thank you for any comments or help about this matter.	15
In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, I came across something that was completely new to me, and I thought I'd offer it for comment. To keep this as brief as possible, let me state my observation as a declarative statement, and then whoever wants to can comment on it. Basically, what I think I've observed is that the phrase "the Ten Commandments", as used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. 20:1 through Ex. 31:18. That is, the phrase "the Ten Commandments" should more accurately be translated "the Ten Discourses", of which the passage we call the "Ten Commandments" is really only the first. I'm not completely convinced that the above is true, but for purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I was sure. Arguments supporting the above idea: 1) There aren't really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17. In order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of them out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods. That is, verse 3 commands to have no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse 4. You can't violate verses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that the whole passage is one command, and leaving us with only Nine "Commandments". I could go on at length about this, but for now I'll just stop with this summary. 2) There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning of the traditional "Ten Commandments") and Ex 31:18 (where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them). I break these ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; 25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; 31:1-11; and 31:12-18. In most cases, each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase, "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying..." The exception is Ex. 21:1, which begins "Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them..." 3) The word translated "commandments" in the phrase "the Ten Commandments" isn't really the word for "commandment", its the word for a speech, or an utterance. It's a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements; for instance, when combined with the word 'yom' (day), this word is translated "Chronicles" in such phrases as "now the rest of the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the Chronicles of x?..." The word for "commandment" is freely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X's, he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command. 4) God tells Moses that He is going to give him the stone tablets "with the law and the commandments" (Ex 24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai. If the Ten Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not immediately clear why God would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to Moses. On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses written on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that God would not give Moses the tablets until He had finished delivering all Ten Discourses. 5) When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both tablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15). If these Ten "Commandments" were only the first 17 verses of Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE letters! Not that He couldn't have, of course, but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal- sized letters. 6) In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out the "commandments written on stone" as being the "ministry of death", "that which is fading away," and "the ministry of condemnation." With the possible exception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in Ex. 20:1-17 as being temporary, "fading away"-type commandments. This is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31. Arguments against this idea: The main argument against this idea, aside from the fact that it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that in Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in Ex. 20:1-17, "These words the LORD spoke...and He added no more. And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me." This appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets. That was my first impression, anyway. However, after some thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase "These words." If Moses meant "These words *which I have just related to you* were spoken by God" etc., then that would mean that only the traditional "Ten Commandments" were on the stone tablets. If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical comment--"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were spoken by God" etc.--then that's quite different. I did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the people asking Moses to represent them before God, whereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of Moses between the first and second discourses, several days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets. This reinforces the idea that Moses' remarks in Dt 5:22ff were intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a strictly chronological account of when God wrote what, and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the tablets. Summary: all things considered, I find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses of God. I don't know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before; it's brand-new to me. So, while I lean towards accepting it, I would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer.	15
Q. Should teenagers have the freedom to choose what church they go to? My friends teenage kids do not like to go to church. If left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option. They complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't attempt to make friends. They mention not respecting their Sunday school teacher, and usually find a way to miss Sunday school but do make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly disgusted) I might add. A never ending battle? It can just ruin your whole day if you let it.	15
Note: the following article is submitted on behalf of someone (Frank daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c, email replies to daniels@math.ufl.edu I am unable to post to the bitnet groups. Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in the Churches of Christ (i.e. Crossroads/Boston): I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800, and indeed some of its roots go back that far, but these were really "influences" on the Movement, and not the actual movement, per se. I will start in c.1920. In that day, there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in nearly every area (due to segregation). Modern Pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon. Here, there was great fanaticism, emphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Many 'white' Protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism. By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was in full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it. When the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950's and 1960's), many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and by what was going on there. This spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60's. In 1969, even the Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups...still evident today. The Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant group. When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it was generally not appreciated. Conservative groups are very strongly resistant to change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo. The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it unfolds. New ideas came into the CofC. There was a big push to reach out to college students, young adults, and teens. Some called this the Campus Evangel- ism Movement. Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large, played a more important role in the new movement. In some places, people began to speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did). This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of Christ. In some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or for advocating the "Holy Spirit Movement", another name for the new branch. The term "Underground Church of Christ" also came into use because these people had to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised). There were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never really caught on). One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville, FL. Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism. They also seemed to put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking. In October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to be its Campus Minister. By 1970, he would move to being the congregation's (lead) Minister. In the late 60's/early 70's, the congregation worked with many other groups. They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring Break. They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus. They also worked with UF sports people. In 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed. When it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer appropriate). It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name that would become legendary. By this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement. While they didn't start it, they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going. By 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at Crossroads. Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require attendance at all church functions. It was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of your problems, pray, and get help from. The concept was called Prayer Partners, which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory. The leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while. The book called "The Master Plan of Evangelism" was a strong influence on Chuck Lucas. He (and the group) believed that it was every person's duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission. Crossroads was growing in number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important). A person who "was evangelistic" was "spiritual". Evangelism meant inviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them converted, then you were "spiritual". There were sermons about how if you bought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services. Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations. Since these people needed Jesus, you should be "aggressive"--don't take 'no' for an answer. If you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called "lazy" or "unspiritual". By the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated into a structure. The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid). Then the group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members. Everyone who came in had someone placed over them. It is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads began to circulate. The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus was tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem. There were many complaints about the congregation and its "pushy" evangelistic tactics. Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ to be "dead" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM. By this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100) where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but also they were sending out "planting" [create a new church] and "reconstructing" [reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities. By this time, the Crossroads Movement was underway. A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in Boston, MA. The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a fraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville). Kip held a still stronger view of church authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s), and not so much in the Elders. He had been fired in 1977 from the congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over- one Christianity. [Called this by critics] In the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want to be a part of the new congregation. They left. But others began coming into the new Boston Church of Christ. Ah, but I'm ahead of myself. At Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on the members. Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but they were not achieving the results that were so important. The numbers were dropping. From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily. The leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely "unproductive" and "unfruitful". The "fruit" passages in the NT were interpreted as referring to new converts. If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, you would be cast into the fire! [Boston still teaches this.] If you love your neighbor, you'll save his soul (invite him to church and convert him). If you're not doing that, you don't love your neighbor. And if you don't love, you're in danger of backsliding. The logical arguments continue in this vein. In 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to recurring sins in his life. These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them. For by now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most Crossroads members and those outside. [If you have contact, your focus should be on converting them. Bring them to a Bible Study.] Chuck's replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the Boston system. As Boston grew in number, they began to offer 'training' sessions for other ministers. Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross- roads ready to emphasize the "total commitment" to the church that Boston and Kip McKean were now emphasizing. Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at Crossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision. Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in Boston. The Elders refused, citing their belief that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston Churches of Christ). Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since Crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the Movement. The group now numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership). The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation. At Crossroads, they taught what was called 'Lordship' baptism: you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized. You had to 'count the cost'. At Boston, they took this a step further. If at some time you became "unproductive", then your spirituality was suspect. People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you were getting into. Anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid: they hadn't counted the cost properly. They still had to be baptized. Others called this "rebaptism", and Crossroads didn't approve of this practice. When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were now called Discipling Ministries. You were either discipling (evangelizing) or you were "dead". They also used the nickname "Movement of God" for a while. By Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now stood alone. They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ, and now none in the Movement. Boston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following. They sent "reconstruction teams" to many cities, which usually meant that they split the church there. They stopped acknowledging other churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the "remnant". The "remnant" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God. It was felt that the "remnant" today represents all the Christians. Sometimes they would simply call their Movement "the church". They usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence. Many campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints. In some cases, it has been documented that Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to have access to the campus. Any resistance that they experience is termed "perse- cution", which all true Christians are expected to experience. Are you really a Christian if you're not being persecuted? The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989. Since then, they have fought to remain steady. I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life's purpose) as God commanded them. Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience. Crossroads once was called a cult. Boston is now recognized by the Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult, under a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ. The term "cult" is usually differentiated from "sect" by the practice of those techniques. The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding Discipleship groups. [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many others have written about the topic.] These techniques include guilt motivation, emotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events), and others. I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement. I have numer- ous friends who are still part of the Movement. I have never had a 'falling out' with anyone in the Movement. I disagree with many things which they teach. I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system. I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their mistakes either. I want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much victims of the system as the members. We do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people. The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members. When members do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel personally responsible as well. The leaders are not out for money or power. They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime. I have said too much, but there is much more to say. There are many examples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston bulletins) that I could include. But this is too long already. You may post this if you so desire. Frank D.	15
The last time we discussed homosexuality, I asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible prohibited, but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone. Put another way, the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my question in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting response based on Roman Catholic theology). However, I think now that I can at least answer my first question. Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one's aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society, that is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage (and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception. The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to how they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but all the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can't a man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is dead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differ from the *duty* to marry one's brother's childless wife. Are these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why. P.S. Please don't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe, as some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions. You don't know whether I am homophobic or not. You don't know me. To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks.	15
From what I understand of my experience in looking up this word, and discussing it with a Greek-literate individual, the meaning of the word is rather clear. Basically it literally means "he who beds with a man" or "he who has sex with a man." The burden of proof is on the pro-homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning. One can speculate all day long that it might mean something else, but we need evidence before we create new doctrines, and get rid of the historical understanding of the meaning of this word.

: Recently an e-mail to me mentioned: : (Technically, the messengers aren't even human so : it *can't* be a case of "homosexuality" -- even of rape.) [...] : The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of : the Sodomites' "lust" for the "other flesh" of angels. Again, : application to homosexual behavior in general, or to the position of : gay Christians is largeely specious. : *** : Are angels "flesh"? No. I feel that this is saying that it was because : of their lust after other men, who are flesh( or of this world). : what are other opinons on this? I haven't heard much about this verse : at all. Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James, Peter, and Jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_, not just the wicked in general. Hence, those who were delivered from Egypt, but did not follow Moses (and, by extension, God); the apostate angels; and Sodom and Gomorrah. Quoting Reike: "Fornication may here, as often in the New Testament, refer to idolatry, while "flesh" (as in I Pet 1:24) denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- exaltation. Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders of apostasy, and the surrounding cities correspond to their followers." [p. 199] There is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for "alien flesh". Nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality, outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin of homosexuality. The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified, and not merely inferred, is in Ezekiel 16:49 "This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, bit did not aid the poor and needy. They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. For the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage doesn't deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly. There are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.	15
I'd like to field this one, if I may. Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive. In fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, I simply _couldn't_ believe in the existence of God. Anyway, when I look back upon the troubles I've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God. The first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God. But way back when, these would cause me some problems, and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe. I can see where others less stubborn than I (and I do mean stubborn. Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time) would fail. The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my life as others would tell me how God would have me live it. A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet. I am not, nor have I ever been, "on fire for Chirst," and I don't think I ever want to be. Nevertheless, I am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so I don't really fit in with the mainstream either. Quite naturally, I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society, and it can lead to a lot of internal tension, when I want to do what I _know_ is right, but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to. Quite naturally, this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God, and during all of this internal strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own. Complete freedom. Of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of God" are behaving like total twits. I can easily understand why someone would go that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back. IMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers. A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now. One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them. Unlike the rest of the world, Christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help them. Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the emporer. Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view. There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don't have time to go into them right now.	15
> When Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words: "Blessed art thou > among women" (Luke 1:42), it appears that this places Mary > beyond the sanctification of normal humanity. But Deborah says (Judges 5:24): > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, > Blessed above all women in the tents. It can doubtless be taken that Jael's slaying of Sisera was a type of Mary's victory over sin. But even if we take Deborah's words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary, they must still be applicable literally to Jael. We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people, and that she has this in common with Mary. But we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she was sinless.	15
(This is a continuation of an earlier post) (I am sorry you found this offensive. It was not my intent to offend. I was leading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.) I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality. Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe. Let me ask this gently: why are you so judgemental of other people's sexual preferences? What happened to "No doubt I am free to do anything"? I think you have a serious double standard here. When you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as "slimey" and "sleazy", you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, unnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about homosexuality. Not all people share your view. You claim not to know any sincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist. They even have their own newsgroup: alt.sex.bestiality. Are you going to accuse them all of being mere "jokers"? I notice you deleted the main point of my comment: the fact that the only Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical prohibitions against homosexuality. While there are some New Testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none that condemn bestiality. One of your main points seems to be that Christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any "clear" New Testament statements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament makes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all? I am quite serious here. If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else's declared sexual preferences as well. If the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well, I'm going to apply them and see what comes up. I'm not trying to "torpedo a serious issue" by using what you label "a ridiculous joke". I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines for Christian sexuality, and I don't think such a question is "irrelevant" in a group called "soc.religion.christian". The Bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good precedent for doing the same. I don't know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a side issue for me. I believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling. I can read in the New Testament that "God has joined together" heterosexual couples, and that the marriage bed is undefiled. I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the Law. If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards of defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days. I don't think it's right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to Christians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn't. That was pretty much what you said earlier, right? You used different examples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction. I personally don't get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation; I'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude. Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse. I have merely noted that, for all the lack of "clear" NT condemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation (or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation. This is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer. I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia. Why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations? Why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals? Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought? A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse. Is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable? A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable. Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual morality? Many people feel that homosexuality does. Do you feel the Bible condemns it? Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality. Why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality? If you can honestly answer this question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality. Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*. I am merely pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that the Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage. When I say I think adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor? When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable, are you disobeying "repeated orders not to judge or condemn others"? When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense? Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible brands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God? I'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs. If you mean that Jesus is the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I agree. If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior. Our salvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, and we can now do whatever we want. Nor does Christ's grace mean that those who refer to sin as "sin" are being judgemental or intolerant. I am speaking in general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality. If the Bible calls something "sin", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it sin too. As applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on Christian sexuality is the Bible. If you make a list of everything the Bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and "unclear" at best. The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse. That is, from a gay perspective, the most positive thing you can say about the Bible's treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it. That's it. Jesus declared all foods clean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to keep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian practice. You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you have some verses which are at best "not clear" but which some people believe *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that's the sum total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse. I can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything simple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked. However, I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to. In fact, I don't believe it says anything positive about your case at all. Yes, I know the verses about loving one another, and not judging one another, but that's not really the issue, is it? You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for Christians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you. Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin. Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not. - Mark	15
Edgar Pearlstein asks (Fri 7 May 1993) whether the Supreme Court, or any other government authority, has attempted a legal definition of religion. The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose "religious training and belief" was opposed to participation in war in any form. It defined "R T & B" as "an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but [not including] essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER, the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit We have concluded that Congress, in using the expression "Supreme Being" rather than the designation "God," .... the test of belief "in a relation to a Superme Being" is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. Where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we cannot say that one is "in a relation to a Supreme Being" and the other is not...." My immediate reference is THE FIRST FREEDOM, by Nat Hentoff, (Delacorte 1980, Dell 1981).	15
[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3] R. Scroggs Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word. Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a "Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology." The term is derived from Lev 18"22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos ("male") and koiten ("bed"), and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar ("lying with a male"). Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term, but borrowed it from "circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions" (180 n.14). It was invented to avoid "contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108). If this is true, Scroggs observes, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it. It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks (108). Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part, thus differing from Boswell's "learned discussion" (107). Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of "one who lies with a male" to have a very narrow reference. With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9), which Scroggs interprets as "the effeminate call-boy," arsenokoitai is the active partner "who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires" (108). Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic model of pederasty. It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he affirms (109). This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also. The combination of pornoi ("fornicators"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ("slave dealers") refers to "male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave dealers [who procure them]" (120). It again refers to that specific form of pederasty "which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes, and the use of these boys by adult males" (121). Even "serious minded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty. He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. Consequently Paul "Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind" (122). We cannot know what Paul would have said about the "contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships" (122). In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul. The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped. Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent. He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item in the lists" (104). Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a "catalogue of vices," Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are "irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today" (129). The "model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT" that "Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate. They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination. . . " (127). REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D. Wright In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny. Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright. In his thorough article, Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell's treatment of arsenokoitai. He faults Boswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the "Apostolic Constitutions," Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129). This is significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half (-koitai). The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps with a male," making arseno- the object. Wright also faults Boswell's claims regarding linguistic features of the term, including suggested parallels (129). Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity: "No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms" (131). Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its object and where "the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its gender" (132). It is with Boswell's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. For example, Aristides' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis, androbaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell's discussion. Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes. The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134). Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ("adultery"), porneia ("fornication"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris (136). Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as "You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis ("you shall not commit adultery"), ou paidophthoreseis ("you shall not practice homosexuality with boys"), you shall not steal. . ." (150 n. 43). Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ("commit homosexuality") exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73. It may be, Wright observes, that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib., book 2 (137-38). Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John the Faster (d. 595) (139-40). The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell. Wright next replies to Boswell's contention that the term would not be absent "from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted (140-41). Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g. Didache) show no acquaintance with Paul's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention (141-44). Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom, omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue. Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26. Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term. Wright observes that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity" (144). It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor. All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning "homosexual" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word (144-45). None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limited conclusion based on them. Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form. He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world. This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence. The term came into being under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke "generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides" (146). If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146). In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism. The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and others who limit the term to "active male prostitutes" or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies.	15
[referring to Mary] I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin. Was Mary fully human? If it is possible for God to miraculously make a person free of original sin, and free of committing sin their whole life, then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus? Why can't God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us sinless, without the need for repentance and salvation and all that? I don't particularly object to the idea of the assumption, or the perpetual virginity (both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ), and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus, but this concept of Mary's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it.	15
Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should check out Dignity, Integrity, More Light Presbyterian churches, Affirmation, MCC churches, etc. Meet some gay Christians, find out who they are, pray with them, discuss scripture with them, and only *then* form your opinion. --	15
Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies falsely, it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely to prophecy truely again. Take, for example the story in Kings about the man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king. The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home. Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house, so he prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his house. While they ate and drank in his house, the Lord gave the prophet who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of the Lord. It came to pass.	15
I wouldn't and don't. I thought I did a pretty good job of qualifying my statement, but apparently some people misinterpreted my intentions. I apologize for my part in communicating any confusion. My intent was more to stir up discussion rather than judge. It seems to have worked. [rest of post noted - by the way, I did not originally post this to alt.atheism. If it got there, I don't know how it did.]	15
Well, Michael, I don't know if clh has left them in the faq (Maybe you should post the "how to get there map again), but I posted two or three lengthy exegetical paper on these verses. They looked at the OT, NT and intertestimental usages of terms in reference. I would suggest you read those before you talk about a "need" in exegetical studies. If those aren't enough, I could also provide "The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai". Dr James DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of '92. To read any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need for honest exegesis. Again, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me a line and I will enclose them to you. Rexlex@fnal.fnal.gov	15
Often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) I've heard the passage from revelation: "...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes words from this book..." used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books. I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons: 1. They weren't added later by the Catholic Church; they were *always* part of what was considered inspired scripture. (This has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason to repeat the info.) 2. It is more likely than not that when St. John (or whomever) wrote the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was ** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands! If one takes the translation of "this book" in REV 18:22 (or somewhere around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely holding something that is in violation of this command. It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the N.T. ones (they didn't like to date their letters, I guess). I really wish I had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but I believe that several of the N.T. letters, chief among them 2 Peter, have their most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D. Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of Domition (sp?), A.D. 80-96. Thus it could be argues that we are all in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the book after the composition of Revelation, when we are told to add nothing more.	15
Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives. I wrote that the Apostle Paul, in Romans 9, speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau, and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done, since they had not been born yet. Clearly, Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it. For if they had had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born." Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad? I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place. As an example, consider the saying in Matthew 6:24 + No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one + and love the other, or.... Now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them. But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place. A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously. It cannot give first priority to both. One must take second place. In our original example, second place means that Jacob, not Esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation, and to be the ancestor of Christ. ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist: + And if ye will receive it, this is ELijah, who was to come. I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure, dressing and living like Elijah, preaching like Elijah, and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah. I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently, neither did he (John 1:21).	15
It is important if Christianity is being damaged by it. If people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises, it damages all Christians, since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects. The more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice. I agree with the point that "Charismatic" practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God; one of the things Jesus warned us about.	15
"CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS" by: Hank Hanegraaff "Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin. Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command." -Dr. Walter Martin Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest evangelical counter-cult organization in the world. In this skillful, careful treatment of an explosive subject, Hanegraaff documents and examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian faith. For the first time ever, this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic. In this book, Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith movement as E.W. Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of "another gospel" (Gal 1:6-9) (Kenneth E. Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick K.C. Price, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, Paul (David) Yonggi Cho, Charles Capps, Jerry Savelle, Morris Cerullo, and Paul and Jan Crouch). The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should be in most Christian Book Stores soon. You can order a hard-back copy through CRI for $14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail mark-ups. The Christian Research Journal, which is a quarterly publication by CRI has an article in it's most recent issue just released called, "What's Wrong With The Word Faith Movement?" This is a good article that will inform you of each of the teachers above, and tide you over until your book arrives. If you are interested in receiving the Journal yourself, you can order it from CRI at the number above for $14 a year. It is the best source of the most-accurate and well-researched info in Christiandom today.	15
If you want parallels the best source is probably the book _Temple and Cosmos_ by Hugh Nibley. It is not light reading however. As to why these early practices "only parallel" and do not exactly duplicate the modern LDS ceremony, there are a couple of reasons: 1. Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient times. This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces undoubtedly spread. (Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony get known.) What we have in the 40 day literature, the Egyptian ceremonies, and certain Native American ceremonies is almost certainly not exactly what Jesus taught.	15
Conviction of Sin A meta-exegetical or methodological essay I look forward to reading it. When I got to the library last week, it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years, since my previous look at the literature. Un- fortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn't get a look at the articles I was hoping to find. I will continue to reserve my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly work, and I can hope that REXLEX's posting may give some meat to chew on. However, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues -- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter. If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better; if not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard. writes, _in abstractu_: [it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and NOT with orientation. I doubt this will have much bearing on the article as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.] The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law. The questions I wish to raise are 1.) how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis? and 2.) what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the discussion) that it is correct? Note that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a), which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word. So far as I know, Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters. Unless you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi- ate text to "fix" the coinage's meaning for his audience. As yet, the extract presents no evidence at all. What do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat plausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way of construing this problem passage.) I'm going to set aside for the moment the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the more tractable question of what it means. For this there are, in principle, two kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external. That is, we can look at the text of Paul's letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul's meaning. The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no internal evidence for Paul's meaning. He uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning. We are left, as the only "internal" clue, with the etymology or formation of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before him) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with other men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ("lie" in Leviticus, "bed" in Greek). One problem is that "bedders" (_-koitai_) is not, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek. THEREFORE, I offer one serious test which de Young's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected: o find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies "men who have sex with X" [obviously, the "best case" is to find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.] such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way. It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under- standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots. Existence of such parallels doesn't *prove* the hypothesis correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible of comprehension by his readers. My "test" moves in the direction of external evidence. If Paul does NOT in his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage) or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering. External evidence, that is, texts other than Paul's own and lexicographic or social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into the picture. *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul, which *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu- ality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one has grounds for o denying that Paul coined the word and o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning Do you see the problem? If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and its intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young's guess) understand him to be referring to the Levitical "universal" prohibition of male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized at least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians -- how else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah law to his gentile converts!) Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined the word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or Ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be assimilated as _arre:n_. To me, this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage. What is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation? And if he *didn't* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for his readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no other.) I cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by this word. We (and his original readers) are guessing. They, at least, had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person. But we have no trace of evidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy. So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word. And it seems to be exceptionally meagre. That is precisely the problem. I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word: a) it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities b) it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their part with the Leviticus passage) c) Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an association with Leviticus in his doing so. He may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundaries. [Since none of his OTHER words in that list have such character, this last seems to me about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I'm advancing.] Of these, I'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but I still have reservations about that, too. If the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence of depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul's coining it. If it does appear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior use (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.) In either of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul's relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be from the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul's relations are hardly straight- forward! There is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis. Your guess is as good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things). But it remains -- so far -- guesswork. And I don't know about you, but I for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God. By all means be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this same character (Romans 14:22-23) "Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going against his conscience. But anybody who eats in a state of doubt is condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done in bad faith is a sin." For my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul's meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by the nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty of constraining Paul's own intent. Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and all the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices -- and sometimes leave his readers puzzled. If that puzzlement leads you to God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul's words HAVE led some people), then Paul's intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences. I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I read him "in the large", if I can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again. I am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.) In my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm that Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as the Leviticus prohibition. My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo- thesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for later Christians. Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night's meditation :-)	15
Okay, I went back and looked: sure enough, my hunch was right. 2 Peter was most likely written between 100-120 A.D. Revelation was almost certainly written between 80-96 A.D. Odds are the gospel of John was written around 90 A.D. Best dates for Luke and Acts are around 80 A.D., maybe later. Again, this is from footnoted information in the New American Bible, the best translation I've come across in regards to giving complete historical information about each book. - Mike )	15
There are exactly ZERO verses that "clearly" address the issues. The kind of interpretation I see as "incredibly perverse" is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape. Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us. The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this. I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by "fornication" or "theft" or "coveting" or "reviling" or "drunkenness" which would well deserve condemnation. We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all "clear" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions, with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas. Homosexual behavior is no different. I (and the other gay Christians I know) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly "harmless" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?] "'I am free to do anything,' you say. Yes, but not everything is for my good. No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one will not let anything make free with me." [1 Cor. 6:12] Which is a restatement that we must have no other "god" before God. A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break. Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior. It is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of God's messengers. I won't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially. Fundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means. There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of which Christians ignore completely. They never even BOTHER to examine them. They just *assume* that they know which ones are "moral" and which ones are "ritual." Well, I have news for you. Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep). And I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the "ritual law" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us. I'm dead serious here. When people start going on (as they do in this matter) about how "repulsive" and "unnatural" our acts are -- and what do they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects. On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law? For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be "law" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about) it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to determine why you "pick" one and ignore another. I frankly think the whole effort misguided. Reread Paul: "No doubt I am free to do anything." But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this, the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor. If you cannot go through Leviticus and decide each "command" there on that basis, then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy. In this context, it is remarkably offensive to say: Well, la-ti-da. So what? This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape. I know of no one who argues seriously (though one can always find jokers) in "defense" of bestiality. It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human adult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut. If you cannot address the actual issues, you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world. If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not mine. And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings. You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so. Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length, the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to love one another, and ALL else depends on that. Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues. Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is. Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ. WHY, for God's precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don't know and won't even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations? Is that loving your neighbor? God forbid! Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others? Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do. Why, for God's sake? "For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned for refusing to believe in the name of God's only Son. Now the judgment is this: the light has come into the world, but men have preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil. For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light, and does not come near the light for fear his deeds will be exposed. But he who acts in truth comes into the light, so that it may be sh0own that his deeds are done in God." John 3:17-21 For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected. Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of God's light. Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous; they shall be justified. However, we have seen the Truth, and the Truth is the light of humanity; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light, but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us.	15
> I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in > Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his "eternal life" > being scorched for his wrongdoings.... Stephen, I suspect that when you and I use the word "Hell," we have different concepts in mind. When you encounter references to Heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do not suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden streets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the concept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that about the "fires" of Hell? Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the last description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the Ferris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant by Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this connection, there are two reasons that occur to me. The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS SHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with matches). The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word "Gehenna," one of the words translated "Hell" in the New Testament. It refers to the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive) to Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires burned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem. "To be cast into Gehenna" or "to burn in Gehenna" thus became a metaphor for "to be rejected or discarded as worthless." Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart is my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT DIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no flames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most bookstores and libraries.	15
I quote from the journal, "30 Days In the Church and In the World," 1992, No. 8/9, p. 29. Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism: In procuring the common good of society the need could arise that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot cause harm. By virtue of this, the right and obligation of public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties, including the death penalty, is acknowledged. For similar reasons, legimate authorities have the right to impede aggressors in society with the use of arms. The Church's traditional teaching has always been expressed and will continue to be expressed in the consideration of the real conditions of common good and the effective means for preserving public order and personal safety. To the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the final goal of protection of peace and human dignity. As is clearly shown by this excerpt, the Church's teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable. I seek to conform my will to the will of God as expounded by His instrument of the visible Church here on earth whenever the question of faith or morals arises.	15
I would like to hear from people who are thinking of going to the Urbana 93 conference in December this year. I have recently received info from IFES (International Fellowship of Evangelical Students) and am thinking about attending although I am still not sure whether I can afford it. I would also like to hear from people involved in IFES or IVF groups just to hear how things are going on your campus. Are there any news groups or groups of people who already do this. I am involved in the Christian Fellowship at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia. If you are interested to find out how we are going mail me to find out.	15
Here is the short answer: because only certain marriages are recorded in Heaven. Now for the long answer: In Doctrine and Covenants section 132, the chapter discussing eternal marriage (and, yes, plural marriage), the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other marriages is revealed. When "the children of this world marry, or are given in marriage" when they receive "the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage" (Luke 20:34-35). Jesus was simply teaching that marriages "until death do you part" are not in force after death. However, the Doctrine and Covenants continues describing eternal marriage. D&C 132:19 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; ... [ shortened for brevity AI] and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exhaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever. The Lord told Peter "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Matt 16:19). Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to perform sealings? Peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were "heirs *together* of the grace of life" (1 Peter 3:7). "In order to obtain the highest" (degree of celestial glory), a man must enter into this order of the priesthood" (D&C 131:2). When a man and wife are sealed they truly become "one flesh" because their eternal "increase" (destinies) are enjoined completely. Our Father has an eternal companion (and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law) who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here. There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine. If fact, the only mention of our Mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the Church: O My Father I had learned to call thee Father, Through thy Spirit from on high, But, until the key of knowledge Was restored, I knew not why. In the heav'ns are parents single? No, the thought makes reason stare! Truth is reason; truth eternal Tells me I've a mother there. Why don't we hear more about our Mother? 1. Because our Father presides under Priesthood authority (which is not a calling for Her); 2. Because we don't all (necessarily) have the same Mother it would be confusing for worship; 3. Because our Father wishes to withhold Her name and titles because of how some people degrade sacred things.	15
Note the difference here. One is saying, if *Christ* disagrees with a Christian being gay, *Christ* can change that. The other is saying, if *I* think being gay is wrong, that a Christian cannot be gay, *I* need to tell them to change. As Lois said, and as before her Paul wrote to the believers in Rome, WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ANOTHER'S SERVANT? -jen --	15
Note: I am breaking this reply into 2 parts due to length. I agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights activists. But if there are zero verses that "'clearly' address the issues," doesn't that mean that there are also no verses that clearly *support* your case? Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly address the issues? The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity to "know" the two men who were Lot's guests; the fact that the Sodomites became angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they were interested only in homosexual intercourse. Yes, what they wanted was rape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong. Some Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as sinful as the rape aspect of their desire. The passage does not say what it was that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended rape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible alternatives in the light of related Scriptures. I do not believe that those who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape. You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to "stigmatize" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape. I can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we're not supposed to start from our conclusions because that's circular reasoning. If God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites' blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape. Later on I will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises *any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults. The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church as the proper authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be legitimate, and thus the church's refusal to recognize "perverted" marriages was circular reasoning. My questions, however, had nothing to do with the church ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a straw man. In terms of my original question, the precise definition/translation of "porneia" isn't really important, unless you are trying to argue that the Bible doesn't really condemn extramarital sex. I'm not sure the moderator was trying to do that. In any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here. When Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, "Have you not read, that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh'? Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate." (Mt. 19:4-6). I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife (female) is a divinely-ordained union. In other words, the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, and not by the church, but by God. Men are not supposed to dissolve this union, in Jesus' words, because it is not something created by men. This is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God's word. I read in the Bible that God ordained the union of male and female. I do not read of any similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females. Granted, there have been uninspired men who have ordained "alternative" unions (isn't Caligula reported to have "married" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to as "what God has joined together" is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife. (Pardon me for mentioning Caligula. I know that's probably inflammatory, and I should save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post. Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply.) Anyway, my original question was not whether we should translate "porneia" in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as divinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful? Of course, I see now that first we need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage. You seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and other sins) are really wrong: Alternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as "porneia" and all the rest was, in Paul's day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the "tutor" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of God's people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death. Perhaps Paul didn't go into detail on what "porneia" &c were because after 1600 years he considered the question to have been dealt with already. Perhaps the reason God's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law. I'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just wanted to point out that the New Testament's failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about sexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality! And how do you define an "obsessively driven" mode of sexual behavior? How do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives? Is the desire to have "sinful" sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior? I think you see that this is circular reasoning: Why is it defined as sinful? Because it is obsessive. What makes it obsessive? The fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it's sinful. Or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns? Once again, that's circular: Why is it defined as obsessive? Because the person wants it even though society condemns it. Why does society condemn it? Because it is obsessive. You seem to be trying to limit the Bible's condemnation of "porneia" to only "perverted" sex acts, but I don't think you can really define "perverted" without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of. What, then, is Paul condemning when he declares that "Fornicators...shall not enter the kindgom of heaven"? I think you misunderstood me: I was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of "porneia", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples. Please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part 2. I am glad you asked. Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this would show that God's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law? If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that God's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the Law? I've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the subject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to rest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on the Sabbath. This illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as "Thou shalt not kill", and requirements that are merely part of the (temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath. The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as "an abomination" is *just* a part of the temporary, Jews-only Law of Moses. I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile. Here's why: Back in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in the possession of "the Amorite"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don't you think? But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds: it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because "the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete". Remember, this is all long before there was a ritual law. What then was the iniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his being cast out of his own land and/or killed? Go back and look at Lev. 18 again. Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, homosexuality, and bestiality. Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, "Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_. For the land has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so the land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these abominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people." Notice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of Moses) are about to be punished because they have "defiled" themselves and their land by committing "abominations" that include incest, bestiality, and homosexuality. Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these same "abominations" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man "lying with another man as one lies with a woman" (Lv. 20:13). Their "bloodguiltiness" was upon them, meaning that in God's eyes, they deserved to die for having done such things. According to Lev. 18:26-29, even "the alien [non-Jew] who sojourns among you" was to refrain from these practices, on penalty of being "cut off [by God?] from among their people." Under the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not the homosexuality, in Sodom. Since God took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the Canaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay sex), I'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant. According to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can learn from studying it. If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law (for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping). Where God reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I conclude that God's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself. In the case of homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the Law as well as for those who are. Thus, I am not at all trying to say that Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the Law. If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.

The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in any way. Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that is going to happen to us. We have free will, and are able to change what happens to us. However, since God knows everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God is not subject to time). Too often arguments pit predestination against free will. We believe in both. That last sentence of Steve's is an important one to remember. There are certain things in the Catholic religion that cannot be completely comprehended by a human being. Were this not the case, it would be good evidence that the religion was man-made. In the case of predestination, you have to reconcile two things that would at first appear to be irreconcilable: the sovereignty of God's will over all things, and man's free will in deciding his own fate. Catholics believe in both! But that doesn't mean that anyone has come up with a pat reconciliation...	15
Seeing as how _The_Two_Babylons_ has been brought up again, it is time for me to respond , once again, and say that this book is junk. It is nothing more that an anti-Catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there were protestants. Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.	15

Dear fellow Christians, I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which I am in. We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, "What??" I did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them (in my point of view, they don't sin as much as I do). How come if they were under Satan, they could have such personalities. To tell you the truth, I don't know much about Islam. But I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of judgement. Now I'm asking you what your opinions about Islam and its teaching. IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not. I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam. P.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian, and bit.listserv.catholic. In Christ, our Lord, Smile......... Jesus loves you....... Tabut Torsina TORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU [Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam, since there's a group for that. But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam. Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians are saved is at the heart of it. The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until the last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism) was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions worshipped false gods, and came from Satan. This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and possibly Jews) will be saved. This need not mean that there's no truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are intentionally Satanic. After all, in order to be an effective snare, Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive. Thus they might contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights. They would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ. If this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily relevant. The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with it. It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners may all be wonderful people. But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention. This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position. Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and nice. Those are good things, and we should encourage them. But no one is able to do them enough to be saved. Salvation requires Christ. (Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms. There's a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in different terms.) A religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways. But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying. Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position. What I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues. Indeed it is now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Satanic. Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past. This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental God. Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Christianity. Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.	15
The biblical arguments against homosexuality are weak at best, yet Christ is quite clear about our obligations to the poor. How as Christians can we demand celibacy from homosexuals when we walk by homeless people and ignore the pleas for help? Christ is quite clear on our obligations to the poor. Thought for the day: MAT 7:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?	15
Maybe before Babel,everyone including angels spoke the same language,so at Babel, God punished us by giving us languages different from the original one. So if that's the case,then angels now would be speaking in the tongue mankind spoke before Babel.	15

Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican variant you bring up. That is, many (not all) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment. I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse. It is indeed this judgemental, controlling legalism of many fundamentalist Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true to the Gospel of Christ, the gospel of love. I have seen this sort of thing too often, even amoung my own relatives, to believe there is no relationship. Judgementalism often leads to overly strict, and thus abusive, discipline of children. [This is not restricted to just Christian fundamentalism, it is found in many extreme sects of other legalistic religions]. I, too, am a Christian. But I do not condone the use of the Bible to justify this sort of abuse. I believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of the misapplication of the Biblical concept of discipline that such abuses can be stopped. Just because someone is also a Christian does not mean we must identify eith them. This sort of sin needs to be made public.	15
whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) writes, But that is exactly what I was asking. If the Homosexual community (is that the proper term?) has decided that Christianity is not against Homosexual behaviour but rather condones it then how do they interpret these verses. I guess what I am really looking for is a "homosexual" response.	15
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. Colossians 3:16 A reminder: These verses are from the New International Version. As with any translation, faithfulness to the original Hebrew and Greek may vary from time to time. If a verse sounds a little off occasionally, compare it with another translation or with the original texts, if you are able to do so.	15

Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily has to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more? Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily so. Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred? Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil and love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be considered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin I see, but why can I not "hate" it?	15
bruce@liv.ac.uk (Bruce Stephens) suggests different levels of acceptance of homosexuality: I would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all people to certain standards of sexual behavior. Promiscuity, abuse of power relationships, harrassment, compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives of homosexual as of heterosexual people. Of course, this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage, and we couldn't have that! :-)	15
You are right, Michael. In John 3:5, Jesus says, "Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit." That's really what He said, and He meant it. That verse is the definition of baptism. I don't have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very reason that you state.	15
(Peter White) writes You've missed on very important passage. 2 Thess. 1:6-10 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was believed. Things to note from this passage. Unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel, and those who do not know God. The eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in 2:16. This distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of God. THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture. Don't confuse the two. Yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven. For instance, If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite. However, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed. Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire. Maybe you don't understand. There will be those who are alive at the end of the millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ. Even those who have died in their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to receive condemnation. This is contrary to the teaching of Scripture. THis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the "no physical body" thesis. The true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ. But whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known GOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped. There will be no defense at the judgment seat of God. THerefore we understand "it is appointed unto man once to die, and then comes judgment" literally. just because it is horrific, doesn't make it less of a reality. it should compel those of us who have the riches of Christ to share it with others	15
Paul's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past, just as the fate of the man born blind (John 9) was not. There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one's destiny. Even the eastern traditions, or many of them, do not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out. And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it. Even John the Baptist, who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to have been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether he is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third. I would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine. For the most part, those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they are Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure. I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed in this newsgroup in particular. I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner. Not that I hold him as an authority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas. Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ's deed on Golgotha. In our own time, it becomes important that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea. For the discussions in this newsgroup, I have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.	15
Welcome. Hm. I get a little queasy around the phrase "aren't morally responsible", perhaps because I've heard it misused so many times. (I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general, most folk can't control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day and think about has some impact on them, hm? And I'm not sure what "actions" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant about the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as our actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally responsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important part of that. I don't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I've had dreams, some fairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably much better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that, than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by dreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help. What on Earth is your definition of "often"? I know exactly one case of two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could see why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only "other plane" I know of is the spiritual realm. I don't think *anyone's* dreams, perhaps outside the occasional prophet's, represent actual actions on an alternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then yes they would have direct moral significance. in a different environment, then different moral laws apply" is my guess of what you said.] I don't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones "environment" changes the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won't it *always* come down to "what Jesus would have us do?" Truth? I don't claim to be an expert in dreams. I'll note that the Bible doesn't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak to us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it warns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.	15

[This was crossposted to a zillion groups. I don't intend to carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt.sex, particularly one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument. However I thought readers might be interested to know about the discussion there. --clh] I intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it. I intend to show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this statement. I intend to also show that such a declaration can be made without there being a religious justification for morality, in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist. Anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side, i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral, or that, collaterally, it is a morally valid practice, is free to do so. I think there are a lot of people who don't believe one can have a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it. This should be fun to try and figure this out, and I want to try and expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people's and see where their ideas are standing. As I'm not sure what groups would be interested in this discussion, I will be posting an announcement of it to several, and if someone thinks of appropriate groups, let me know. If someone on here doesn't receive alt.sex, let me know and I'll make an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as I'll use that as the main forum for this. By "exception to usual policy" is that I normally charge for this, but for the duration the service will be available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on Internet or Bitnet. I decided to start this dialog when I realized there was a much larger audience on usenet / internet than on the smaller BBS networks. To give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger, this will begin on Monday, May 24, to give people who want to make the response time to identify themselves. Anonymous postings are acceptable, since some people may not wish to identify themselves. Also, if someone else wants to get in on my side, they are free to do so.	15
Ok, what's more important to gay Christians? Sex, or Christianity? Christianity I would hope. Would they be willing to forgo sex completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others, to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong, etc? If not, why not? Heterosexuals abstain all the time. (It would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life) To tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of Henry the VIII starting the Church of England in order to get a divorce (or is this a myth). Note that I am not denying that gay Christians are Christian.	15
This is true. The statement didn't say anything about Christians in general. It specifically said "strict fundamentalist" Christians. It reflects a common perception that people have about fundamentalists being strict disciplinarians. Whether or not this perception is justified is another issue.	15
I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the "homosexual" issue and the "atheist" issue. Please take no offense at these comparisons. The homosexual "feels" things that I admit I do not "feel". He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences. That is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation. Models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded. However, one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates his model. If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel. The Christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not feel. The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean. Once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his Christianity. As a reminder, I am a Christian, a Catholic, I don't hate homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand them. I only compare them because they are both so foreign to me. Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against attempts by society to deny his sexuality? Or am I just out to lunch, again?	15
: |>You might visit some congregations of Christians, who happen to be homosexuals, : |>that are spirit-filled believers, not MCC'rs; before you go lumping us all : |>together with Troy Perry. : |> : Gee, I think there are some real criminals (robbers, muderers, drug : addicts) who appear to be fun loving caring people too. So what's : your point? Is it OK. just because the people are nice? The point is not about being "nice." "Nice" is not a christian virtue. The point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall know them- Mt 7:20) are manifested by and among prayerful, spirit-filled GAY christians. It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles that convinced Peter (Acts 10) that his prejudice against them (based on scripture, I might add) was not in accordance with God's intentions. : I think the old saying " hate the sin and not the sinner" is : appropriate here. Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably : don't hate the people. I don't. I don't hate my kids when they do : wrong either. But I tell them what is right, and if they lie or don't : admit they are wrong, or just don't make an effort to improve or : repent, they get punished. I think this is quite appropriate. You : may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here. : Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through : feel goodism. Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more : than God. Kind of like the Adam and Eve story. Read it and compare : it to today's mentality. You may be suprised. Of course the whole issue is one of discernment. It may be that Satan is trying to convince us that we know more than God. Or it may be that God is trying (as God did with Peter) to teach us something we don't know- that "God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him." (Acts 10:34-35).	15
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently, often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality... but the context really isn't that important. My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not. Hate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I'll leave it unnamed since I don't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build love. In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians supposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We need to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love with theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to love someone is to pray for them. - Scott	15
ites: I realized that my generalizations would probably have problems under scrutiny from various Asian points of view. They need to be discussed in detail, indeed. But for the purposes of this newsgroup and thread thus far and in this newsgroup, I risked oversimpli- fication. My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming from a Buddhist or Hindu point of view. As you observed, the main context is that of Christianity. But by all means, add comments and corrections as you find them. I wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points, but decided to not post it. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion. eastern. Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and a Christian point of view. 1. Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a "judging deity". 2. Reincarnation is not the same as being born again. 3. Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body. 4. Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings of Christianity about God, the fall, the being. incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ, his coming again, sin, grace, forgiveness, salvation, and the last judgement. Origen's work was mostly lost. He was not anathematized, to my knowledge, but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies. Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen. I don't know if there is a specific statement about reincarnation from him, but from what I do know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another. I don't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in the Church. However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow. The Pope likes to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen. My acquaintance, an anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and Anthroposophy from his early days. Before he became a priest he was an actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner and based his acting and directing methods on Steiner's indications. Part of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy. Well, going to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about Anthroposophy. They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask him what he thought about reincarnation. The Pope smiled and said, "Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in reincarnation," and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times to modern times. Then he changed the subject. My Polish friend did not say whether Origen was among those he mentioned. Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)	15

There is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the Mormon writings. In the book in the book of Mormon called the book of Jacob, Joseph Smith wrote that it was an abomination to God for David and Solomon to have many wives. Later, when Joseph Smith wrote the Doctrines and Covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for David to have many wives. How do Mormons answer this contradiction?	15

Just a quick comment. As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and they seldom are regarding religion) offensive. The pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent. We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert. If in fact the grace of God might work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or two. Baptist believe in regenerate membership. Did this church include these half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose? This kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not very christian, either.	15
What you call "the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it" is precisely the result of the first Christians getting together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your question "what is a Christian?". I can't see what you are objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot? You really ought to say what you mean by "belief in Jesus Christ". It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a Christian. Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God. But followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of other historical and mythical figures. So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it is to be a Christian, as handed down by the Universal Church, you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian.	15
the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD Almighty, let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.	15
IMHO this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough. I do not like a God who prays to Himself. I refuse to believe Jesus prayed to Himself -- let's get real, if the scriptures say He prayed to the Father, then the Father IS someone different than the Son. I have no problems with multiple Gods. To me, the whole context of the scriptures co-heirs with Christ; that we will be like Him. Co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc. When I am like Him (Christ), I will be the same as HE is--and He is a God. If God cannot do this, the His is not all powerful--and He is NOT God. If He will not, He is a Liar--and He is NOT God. But if He does, He is the greatest of all the Gods.	15
I will remind this list that I have a booklet on Fatima I will send to any one who wants it. It is "Our Lady of Fatima's Peace Plan from Heaven". It is 30 pages in length and includes the Fatima story. If you want one or more, let me know.	15
Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle "God Wants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines", which discusses OOBEs in one of her chapters. In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit (eg Ezekiel, Paul). I believe that also this experience is counterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to leave the body and float off. Someone tried to sell me a book in Los Angeles airport entitled "Easy Journeys to Other Planets" which uses such techniques. The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body departure - the book "The Challanging Counterfeit", about a former medium who gets saved, tells how the author, on his last trance, was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him while returning to his body at the end of the seance because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally protected by the Lord. There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the phenomena of 'tripping'. As regards the connection between body and soul, there is an interesting verse in Ecclesiastes. In a passage talking about old age, the preacher writes "Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets. Remember Him--before the silver cord is severed." (12.5-6) My understanding of this silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronaut's air-line to his spaceship. When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken: astral projection can be dangerous! Bulle, I think, reports a case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his apartment, with no apparent external cause.	15
I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others may not have the reference. "And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents." What is "the sin" of the parents? Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle. However, it assumes that fathers and sons have equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment. Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills. Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their children, the parent would be held responsible -- not for their children's sins, but for not teaching them properly. Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge. In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel." "If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with "parents have children in Zion" I believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children whatever good principles they understand. However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly.	15
way.qub.ac.uk writes (single angle brackets): ng There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John. The passage in Matthew is very direct. Where Luke (1:17) reports the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ "in the power and spirit of Elias", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John, "And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who was to come". It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, "If you care to accept it", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein- carnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it is. A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of reincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews today, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah Hurnard ("Hinds Feet on High Places") was told about it by a Rabbi she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine. Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this, whereas the large number of people did not. The statement of Jesus about John, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded but nevertheless quite direct. Again, the subject of reincarnation, one way or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement. But there are occasional indications that point to it. As for the "popular belief" that Elijah would come again, it was more than a popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never corrected those who were expecting Elijah -- for example, those who thought that Jesus himself be he.	15

Interesting question, esp since I remember *wishing* with all my heart that this *were* true so that I wouldn't have to be a "good Christian" anymore. "Christianity" was terribly hard, the only reward was Heaven and (maybe, sometimes, if I was really good) acceptance; I wanted a way out. What Jesus has done for me since I found Him (some 6 months ago) I do not want to lose. Period. That said, I originally interpreted the What-If as "if Christ never mentioned Sheol and weeping and gnashing of teeth, if Christ preached that those who did not follow him died and stayed dead and at that point forever ceased to exist...." I believe that we can only be complete through Christ. Do you think that Buddhists can also be complete? -jen --	15
Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth. They should remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I, Jerome did not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as Scripture in his later writings. And as I have already pointed out, in a previous letter on this subject, the Catholic Church has accepted the deuterocanon from the beginning. And the Protestants in the 1500's all of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by Pope, Council, and Church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired. Again, why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the unbelieving Jews, drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD, in countering the Christian use of the Septuagint. ^^^^^	15

"Should any system of belief or practice to which people are committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph, isolation of such from political and educational influence would constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of civil rights."	15
This week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on OT, NT and Intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue. I have refered you to the FAQ files, which I find out, no longer contains them. They are too long for me to mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the FAQ file. Because of the renewed interest on this subject, I will type, with permission, an article by James DeYoung. I think it is one of the best articles that I've read todate from the conservative position. I can't post it all at once, so it will come piece meal and not daily. After I'm done retyping the entire article, I will make it available for the FAQ file. Talk to clh. Also, for those who can't get through to me, you may try one of these: REXLEX@FNAL.FNAL.GOV LEXREX@ALMOND.FNAL.GOV Loren Senders@ADMAIL.FNAL.GOV THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY James B. DeYoung Professor of New Testament Western Conservative Baptist Seminary Portland, Oregon Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex, specifically homosexualitiy. Some restrict the term's meaning to "active male prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation, namely "homosexuals." More recently the definition "homosexual" has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term "homosexuals" is anachronistic. In addition, criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world. The foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. Finally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline (I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11). ************************************* INTRODUCTION Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy. As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used twice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous scrutiny. This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements. More particularly, the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation. This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution. Several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word. Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the ministry.	15
being gay and Christianity are not compatible should I would absolutly love to have the time and energy to do so. The problem is to be totally fair I would have to go throught this type of search on every issue I belive in. I don't have the time, resources, or ability to do what you ask. Maybe you should pray that God gives me the opportunity instead of simply discrediting me because I have not been able to talk to every gay christian.	15
I'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which I've been thinking about: What was the process used to divide the Bible into verses. I believe Jerome divided the New Testament, but I've never seen any discussion of *how* he did this. It seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for example, making each sentence a verse.	15
whitsebd@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu (Bryan Whitsell) sent in a list of verses which he felt condemn homosexuality. mls@panix.com (Michael Siemon) wrote in response that some of these verses "are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations" and that others "simply do not address the issues." [remainder of my post deleted] The moderator then made some comments I would like to address: If you are referring to the terms "effeminate" and "homosexuals" in the above passage, I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged. However, I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an "incredibly perverse" interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality. Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality; however, I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse. Therefore I do not believe it is "incredibly perverse" to read it in this way. Actually, I wasn't thinking of the church at all. After all, a couple doesn't have to be married by a minister. A secular justice of the peace could do the job, and the two people would be married. My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage, but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex? And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to "save themselves" for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship? Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject. I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual, yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position. So what is the gay view? - Mark	15
This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and "proves" that we can be saved by works alone! If we have no original sin, then it is possible for us to save ourselves by not sinning. I understand the reasoning behind your argument, but it leads to sheer folly. Original sin is the reason we need faith to be saved.	15
[a lot of stuff deleted -- i'm focusing on just one point] i'm a little confused about the difference between this "weak atheism", as you put it, and agnosticism. is agnosticism not believing or necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it? i used to be agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not necessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those. ??? actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not ever decide what they believe. i am constantly in a state of self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the atheists, of course -- i'd assume that's why they're here!). i guess some people don't really consider it important to think about the answers to "life, the universe and everything" -- any comment? just wondering.... tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it didn't work too well! especially tough as i'm still mulling over whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my chaplain is coming up....). all i can do is wish you the best of luck, and please do post what you find. hmm, how so? i guess i really don't understand. there are times, of course, when i say to myself "of course i have absolutely no way of knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be psychological". somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you mean? the only "proof" i have is that i believe God spoke to me once -- which could of course be my own imagination. the odd thing is, though, that if you don't at some point start believing in something, after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous. maybe it's just a question of where you draw the line. i'll only add one question -- have you read pascal? what did you think of him if you did? also you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis/ _surprised by joy_. i'd be interested in knowing what you think of him, no sarcasm at all intended. (i just say this because one can never know how one's written words will be interpreted. i am not interested in converting you, since i don't seem to have whatever it would take -- proof -- to do so. i'm just interested in learning.) i like this.	15
I recently came across this article which I found interesting. I have posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue. I realise it is rather long (12 pages in Wordperfect) by may well be worth the read. Except for the first page (which I typed) the rest was scanned inusing Omnipage. Some of the f's have come out as t's and visa-versa. I have tried to correct as much as possible. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Peter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship, a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in Southern Africa. He has also made several visits to many East European countries. FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS ISSN 1018-144X PRAYING FOR JUSTICE (by Peter Hammond) To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of comfort. And those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn, or battling social evils such as pornography or crime, are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms. THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them. Prayers such as: "Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for his wickedness ..." Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for God ("The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nation will perish from His land" 10:16, and "Why does the wicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who suffer ("You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You encourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth, may terrify no more." 10:17-18) Nevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: "Pour out your wrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them" 64:24; "O Lord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O Judge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve." 95:1-2; "Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.'" 58:6-11 Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil - but could I actually pray for God to "pour out His wrath" on the wicked? The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies. Rather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against His enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who "boast of evil" and "are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots destruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise deceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth." 52:1-3; "They crush your people ... They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless." 94:5- 6; "With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot against those You cherish." 83:3; "You hate all who do wrong. You destroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors." 5:5-6. To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares: "Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin" 52:5; "Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who go on in their sins" 68:21. And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: "Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ..." 59:13; "to proclaim the powers of God" 68:34; "All kings will bow down to Him and all nations will serve Him " 72:11; "Who knows the power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due You. " 90:11 Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include imprecations (prayers invoking God's righteous judgement upon the wicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church. However, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common. PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church. I was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven pray "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?" Revelation 6:10). The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino Neto. Described as a "drunken, psychotic, marxist poet", Neto had been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola. He boasted that: "Within 20 years there won't be a Bible or a church left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity." Yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto. Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in Moscow. In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer: * A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack. * Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in fact carried out. But the next day when the official was medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal cancer. He died shortly afterwards. * On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day. * When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation, the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship. "They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. " Acts 19:17,20 Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of "the antiChrist is dead" in the streets. Many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of Romania. Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora Machel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960's. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly Marxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in Mozambique were closed confiscated, "nationalised" chained and padlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled, some being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians, including many pastors and elders, were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again. A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him (Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in Mozambique, Machel's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's boundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and published. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor, but He had also saved a country from persecution. In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on 31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian country. It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots, declared trembling and in tears: "I am more afraid of John Knox's prayers than of an army of ten thousand". On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa this Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani. The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other victims. Indeed the SA government, the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were unbanned! Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973, Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC's "military wing" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: "all who live by the sword will die by the sword " Matt 26:52. After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly declared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during "the struggle") I told him that I was a Christian and, while I didn't hate him, I did hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God would remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist. Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani to repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against unrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck down, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer, within months of these public prayers for God to stop these killers of preborn babies. Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted: "When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers " Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory prayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did our Lord (Matt 11:20-24). What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be? Should we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I would like to present a short summary of an excellent book, "War Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory Psalms" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company): Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly in teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the Old Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT are from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50 times. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible. 1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God? Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as "devilish", "diabolical ", "unsuited to the church", and "Not God 's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus' teaching that we should love our enemies. " Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares: "All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. " (see also 2 Peter 3:15-16). The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of God. Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God have led many to become "evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to "clean up" God's Word according to their own ideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for His Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the authority of God's Word (like Eve's original sin of listening to Satan's question "Yes, hath God said... ?"). The Psalms are part of God's revelation of Himself and His attributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the authoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as "unsuited" and "unworthy" for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about Himself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles used as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb 4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2. CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially Ps 109): "Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage which the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would speak to us therein. " The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of the giver of that Word, God Himself. 2. Who is praying these Psalms? Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually spoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at the Last Supper. On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient authority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own words - the words of the Lord's Anointed - which as David's Son He truly was. "Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5 "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" Ps 22:1 In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on the day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so! Matt 7:23 "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers'. " Ps 6:8 In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said these words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22 directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having spoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed Christ is speaking in the Psalms. Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in all the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again to execute Judgement on the wicked. David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a prototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30: "being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ. " David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in his words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah spoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by Christ. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His forerunner David. The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of God, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion for the wronged. 3. But what about the Psalms of repentance? Christ is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with the sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for which He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the substitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah 53). "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. " 2 Cor 5:21 In history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St Augustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others. All the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the imprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy His enemies. These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of King Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God's Word is revealed upon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God's way of forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses of God. He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when He declares to those on His left: "Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. " Matt 25:41 All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God's Kingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone will reign forever! "With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. " Rev 19 : 15 4. Are Jesus' prayers contradictory? What about Jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us (Matt 5:44)? Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives sin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement on those who disobey His Gospel. "God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. " 2 Thess 1:6-10 Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on earth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot God. Even in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations. "Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? " Matt 23 In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His betrayal by Judas. We also need to acknowledge that Christ's prayers of blessing are not for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only praying to the elect of God - those who have: "obeyed your Word"... "accepted" God's Word ... and have "believed ". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the message of God's kingdom will be judged.) 5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms? Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays: "Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done " then "he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say: 'Curses, maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground' . " To pray tor the extension of God's kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: "The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. " * Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness. * There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church cannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God's kingdom. God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom being destroyed. God's will cannot be done on earth without the destruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of evil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God. Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who "plot together" against God and His people: "Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O Lord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. " The story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5) provides a vivid example of God's judgement on the wicked. Sisera "cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years" and they "cried to the Lord for help" Judges 4:3. In response to those prayers: "The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot... All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. " Judges 4:15-16 The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of the head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "As you did to Sisera ..." 6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God: "If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law until you are destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ... so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. " Deuteronomy 28:58-63 The covenant God made with His people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account: "The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: "Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman's hands - and sets it up in secret. " Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " "Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother... "Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour's boundary stone... "Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads... "Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow... "Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly... "Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. "Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by carrying them out. Then all the people shall say, "Amen!" " Deut 27:14-26 The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting Christ is the curse. "If anyone does not love the Lord - a curse be on him. " 1 Corinthians 16:22 (See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26- 31; 12:14-29.) 7. How can we preach these prayers? The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders. Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander- in-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we expect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not hear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him onto the battlefield? Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's Commander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general's orders. The pastor's charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army. There's no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn't agree with his Commander's strategy. When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God's Kingdom (Lk 10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God's rule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected it, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we must consider what He said they should do if their message were rejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against God's rule - "But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its 'streets and say, 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near"' Luke 10:11. What would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that town (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message (verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great authority He had given them: "He who listens to you listens to Me; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects him who sent Me " (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor calling down God's curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion against God's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of His servants. We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the Prince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable. Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is that God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he reap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings 6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant breakers is real. The "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The "we" of the Psalms includes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our own, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record Christ's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As Christ is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will answer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the final day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when He will say: "But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me" Luke 19:27. A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's kingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of God, including "the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God " Eph 6:17. That battle- readiness also involves "pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18. Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of God as the psalmist did: "Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name" Ps 79:6. To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for God's justice. Those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers. "Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against them. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. " Ps 149:5-9 Prayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He has given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people nf God to destroy evil. If you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or undermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword anew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of Jesus - until "the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea" Hab 2:14.

I would like to see his reasoning behind this. You may have gotten "burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is false. Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious that judgement prophecies can be valid. here in the US, it seems like we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though I am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement. Sometimes God does give words that are difficult to swallow. The relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to dismiss it. Much of the OT is not happy stuff.	15
No smiley on the part about atheism, I see. Do you realize that your statement says that I was mentioning "nonsense" about atheism? This is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making, as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first. Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand. But, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be misinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism "nonsense"? If so, care to back up that claim? OK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I "broken"? *YAWN* Excuse me, I don't recall any portion of my post in which I called Christians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity "silly" and then following that up with information that I was nine years old when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's existence. I define "faith" as "belief in the absense of any proof", BTW. Also, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types there, so in answer to your question: "no." Finally, I'd hardly call Christianity "beseiged" in this country. I seldom see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don't know for sure, of course, I only say I haven't seen it happening. What I have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people who claim to be Christ's followers. I know that this sort of thing isn't practiced by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and I don't see comperable victimization of Christians. The implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I'm not a student of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and Linguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications I see are improper, please let me know. I'm here because I'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don't_ think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see "atheist" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn't deserve your respect? Aw, geez. I'm sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high, here. It's just that the "nonsense" thing really annoys me. I figure you should see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to your question. Now, the smoothed feather version: I seek all sorts of knowledge. That's why I came to my university. Yes, I am looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of Christian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view. I've been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don't know the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists I figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want (hence the "amatuer" psychology crack), but without an atheist, you can't be sure of even one atheist's motive. I'm hoping people really want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I actually think about these things. Instead, I'm still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only "broken" people are atheist. Try it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn't follow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous mix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions so successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which "breaks" people. It's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another reason I'm here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies :). ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The implication here being that atheists can't possibly know anything about Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my reaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that atheists are "broken", hostile people. This post confirms that someone else believes it. ^^^^^^^^^^ Well, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of evidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies lack of existence. However, I haven't met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a "seeker" if you like, I don't. _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say "I don't believe in any god" rather than my position: "I believe that no god(s) exist." For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve, because they don't actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is confusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view :). This is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in something (followed up by "everyone has faith in something"). Guess what? My atheism ends the moment I'm shown a proof of some god's existence. Is that really too much to ask? Well, I guess you won't succeed in converting him or me. Why the supposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is it because you yourself are unconvinced? :) And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how. I have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that's how I'm "broken"? I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you think. All I ask for is proof of the assertion "God exists". Logical or physical proofs only, please. Then we'll discuss the nature of "God". Prayer?! Uh, oh, we'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :) Good luck to you, as well. And, again, I apologize if the inferences I made were inaccurate. Muppets and garlic toast forever, Max (Bob) Muir	15

The cited passages are covered IN DEPTH in a FAQ for this group. That particular FAQ (I've forgotten the author) discusses the traditional vs. pro-homosexual interpretations of the passages and indicates which points have strong textual support. Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic? BTW, this issue, while dealt with before, is VERY timely. One of the major Presbyterian churches in California (St. Andrews -- a MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood) is withholding their support of Synod (amounts to about 10% of the budget of the Synod, which covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii) until support for a pro-homosexual lobbying group (the Lazarus Project) is terminated. [This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome.] Tim [I think it's time for me to post the FAQ. This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church. On the other side, one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders, and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so. And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they couldn't install a homosexual pastor has made her an "evangelist". These situations, as well as the one you describe, do not appear to be stable. This will certainly be a major topic for the General Assembly next month. If the church can't come up with a solution that will let people live with each other, I think we're end up with a split. Clearly neither side wants that, but I think we'll get pushed into it by actions of both sides.	15
If you were to start your own religion, this would be fine. But there is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem. You think you know more than scripture. Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God. Just because they are nice people doesn't make it right. You can start all the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong. That is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and forgiveness that anyone else does. But to call their behavior right just because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers Satan a perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.	15
There is no reason to believe that Paul's thorn in the flesh was a sin in his life. That makes little sense in the light of Paul' writings taken in totality. He writes of how he presses for the mark, and keeps his body submitted. No doubt Paul had to struggle with the flesh just like every Christian. Paul does associate his thorn with a Satanic messenger, and with physical infirmities and tribulation, but not with a sin in his life.	15
I get the feeling that we are debating at cross-purposes--that we do not see the same fundamental assumptions, and this perhaps makes my answers orthogonal to your questions. I will try again. Perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively observable and provable things. In that case, I cannot show you that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need--these things do not exist in the realm of the objective, but in the realm of the subjective. (By a.a., I assume you mean Alcoholics Anonymous, and not alt.atheism ;) I would not say that AA "handles" spiritual needs. Rather I would say that AA (and other 12-step programs) help people come to terms with their needs--ie that AA is facilitating the recovery, and that as part of the recovery, they recognize their spiritual needs, and begin to rely on a "higher power" (12-step's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse they had been accustomed to. (Sorry, there is no objective proof here either--no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover by fulfilling spiritual needs, and one without and externally compare the difference--we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of *people* here.) Spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to physical requirements like air, food, sleep, etc. These are things like the need for love and acceptance, and the need for meaning in life. If one denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call these "emotional needs". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual means--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do many meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be satisfied by the love of God. Now the problem is that there are people who accept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them. Since I believe in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others are wrong. So here are the 2 possibilities: 1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie we all need God. Those who do not realize that they need God are deluded--they just haven't recognized it yet. 2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain chemicals. Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not have such things. Christians are simply using the concept of God and spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies. I hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence of God cannot. And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals. But on the other hand, I could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals. I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion is that such things are not objectively demonstrable. As I have said before, I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism, having been pushed off the fence by subjective evidence. (And no, I was not raised a Christian, so it is not a case of simply accepting what I was indoctrinated with.)	15
Alan> 2. We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing: "Marvel Alan> not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). Alan> Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus -- a Alan> ruler of the Jews (not a child). Yes, but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation: "Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit." (John 3:6) Clearly infants are not born of the spirit. Thus, without baptism they are unspiritual. They are not born with the image of God, but in Adam's fallen image (cf. Gen 5:3). They have no righteousness of their own, just as adults have no righteousness of their own. There is only the imputed righteousness of Christ, which believers receive through faith. Alan> 3. We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the Alan> concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies Alan> weren't free from sin? Your point is a little obscure here, but I think you are saying that Christ used the "innocence" of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth. But this is not what he did. If you look at the text, he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth. We are born of the Spirit once, not twice or several times. We are also born of the flesh once. The Lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events. It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth (for example, Titus 3:5). But it is not a second *spiritual* birth. The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth, which is used as a symbol of `new life' -- not of innocence. When an infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun--but it is neither innocent nor righteous. Similarly when that same individual is baptized, or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism, they begin a new life in Christ (Romans 6:3, Colossians 2:12, Titus 3:5, Ephesians 2:5). Then the believer has God's assurance of the forgiveness of their sins, and of Christ's imputed righteousness.

But wouldn't that go for any sin. My father told me when he was growing up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced. There are a few verses prohibitting divorce. Somehow, divorce became acceptable (even in Catholicism anullments). Certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person. The point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with. Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side, some think it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows. Whatever the thorn was, apparently it was not "compatible" with Christianity, yet does that make his epistles any less? The Bible warns us against judging, greed, anxiety, impure thoughts, bearing grudges, etc., etc. I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them. All those who have given in to greed, get 'em outta here. Jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners. Any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with Christianity. Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to Jesus, we need to keep them away. Does Jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin. Do we really mistrust Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin? Think about it. Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and the Pharisees. The sinners he embraced and forgave. The Pharisees, hypocritcal, unmerciful, self-righteous, pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins. What I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins, those sins will not be forgiven. And since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law, those not repenting the judging of others are guilty, as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of. The poor in spirit, meek, humble, merciful, pure of heart, peacemakers, those who thirst for justice, those who suffer for His sake are blessed.	15
Maybe you should dig a little further Charles. Hislop's scholarship was accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere Institute for Oriental studies. As I've stated over and over, I've checked out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit. THey too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed. Both were highly honored by the British Oriental Museum. Wilkerson is known as one of the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions. He was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology. Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions. Hislop did not. His conclusions do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident. But to assert that his conclusions are "spurious" is without merit. He gave references to all his conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one. No counter to Hislops scholarship was made. The only rebuttals were against his conclusions because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown even to this day in various articles and topics). THe tongues movement in Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church. If it was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of seven hills? Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries. You don't even have to be a believer to see the parallels. Just one example. THe mitre. Where did it come from? Why is it shaped the way it is? What are the two tails that hang down the back represent? Was this an ancient head dress from an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the church of the State of Rome? Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so, why did the RCC chose regardless? Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions. Even the scriptures themselves refer to it. All Hislop did was collect the information from all the various sources and put them in one binding. There is no lack of scholorship in that. Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no evidence supporting it.	15
>Subject: hate the sin... >Date: 12 May 93 08:27:08 GMT >"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently, >My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I >would think not. Hate begets more hate, never love. If you are questioning whether or not "hating sin" is consistent with Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture: Romans 12:9 "Let Love be without hypocrisy. Hate what is evil, cling to what is good." What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is calling us to hate? Would God call us to do something that would eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to do the opposite, to love your fellow man? >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our "hate the sin..." philosophy and see >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to >hate the sinner. That has not been my experience. I've not found myself hating anybody as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life. As a sinner myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person. Jesus too, since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall. Jesus is our very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner. In the account of the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman; BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin. This is what it means to love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally, while at the same time calling them to leave their sin. >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe >what they are doing is a sin). The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the Christian. I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it. It was not unloving for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most loving thing that that person could have done. He loved me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin. >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don't >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build >love. Again, I don't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of the Christian. If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we can. We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have rejected it. Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we will, ourselves, be in sin. >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our >neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New Testament. I really think that you will be surprised. >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent. Hope this helps, In Christ, Tony Balsamo --	15
Easy vs. Hard .....Easy on who? I had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year. She said that when she and my father were raising we four children, they did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised in their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be alienated from them and it would create problems. In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They raised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances. What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended Him...sins that the "world" told me were OK. My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised four extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more complete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice and punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many grave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for change...but I shouldn't have married to person in the first place ) and more.... My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing us to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or counsel. Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they *did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and difficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able to say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and compassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not want to hear and will stay away from you. This life is "but dust". As long as the comfort of this life is our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those with whom we come in contact. I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who support the "right" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality, or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in this time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving friend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that what I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me living the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent people. (wouldn't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..) It is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer life to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend. Think about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that a friend is in error, but you don't want to "cause trouble". Righteous prayers is great power, but don't forget that we are we are Christ's lips and hands on earth. Don't be afraid to simply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a fervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance. In more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother's keeper.	15
While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation. There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus, Jains, Buddhists (and even among the various Buddhist traditions.) To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions. Karma is considered to be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape a person's predilections for future intention and action and produce a person who is more prone to good than evil, or the opposite -- "reward" has nothing to do with it. Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments. Karma is usually described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof. In fact "As you sow, so shall you reap" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor of natural growth is explicit. Hinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being theistically inclined. In point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia considers karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics of karma without the element of free will. Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations. Isn't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among Christian thinkers? What were his views, and how did he relate them to the Christian scriptures?	15
Stephen A. Creps writes to All: [...] SAC> Also, we know that SAC> the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. Where exactly does it say that? SAC> _Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the SAC> contrary, i.e. an exception. Since there is no exception listed in the SAC> Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what SAC> it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. I think we do see an exception in the case of Cornelius and his household, mentioned in Acts. Of course, they were baptised, but only after "God showed that He accepted them by giving them the Holy Spirit". This means they were already acceptable to God before their baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven. In case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary who worked among the Hereros in Namibia. Some of the tribesmen were jealous of Christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he could be baptised. Surely he still went to heaven? I'm inclined to agree with a comment recorded at the time: "It is not the neglect of baptism, but its contempt, that condemns." Mike	15
You forgot one thing "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God". Mark	15
He appears to have believed that. He had a view which was condemned by conciliar action, which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation. What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul before birth. Similar, but not exactly the same thing. Larry Overacker (ll@shell.com) --	15

Paul Fortmann submitted a sermon by Peter Hammond on PRAYING FOR JUSTICE that spoke of the positive value of the Imprecatory (Cursing) Psalms. In this connection, I recommend to the membership the book REFLECTIONS ON THE PSALMS, by C S Lewis, with special reference to the chapter on "Cursing in the Psalms."	15
Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes control their dreams. For example, I might decide before going to sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a specific place. Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant. I guess I think that the same standards apply in these "directed" dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing adultary). When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my "inner life" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin. In either case, the cause needs to be resolved. In fact, either case is pretty rare. I don't often remember dreams that I don't chose to have. When I do, they almost always tell me something important. I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour (in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can remember, and it was definately spiritually important) I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and white. Interesting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses. Alison	15
Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations 20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the Matthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual. From Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell, if it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the unbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on continually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it. It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid regardless of its exact nature. There seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought: What is God's main plan on earth? Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed to simply destroying completely those who refuse God? I believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship with people. The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something to avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has nothing to do with God. In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance, it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a physical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive, at some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement, the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without God. The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people won't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ. It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant.	15
Is anybody using David Rapier's Hebrew Quiz software? And can tell me how to *space* when typing in the Hebrew? (space bar doesn't work, for me anyway...) Email please; thanks. Ken	15
Actually in D&C 68:25-28 the parents are being held accountable for their own sins. Specifically they are accountable for their failure to teach their children properly. If I fail to teach my children that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they later indulge in such behavior.	15

So do other parts of the Bible when taken literally - i.e. the Psalms saying the Earth does not move, or the implication the Earth is flat with four corners, etc. The Bible was written to teach salvation, not history or science. What ones? Paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints? (Which are taught in 2 Maccabees, Sirach, and Tobit) By your own subjective judgement. This falling short is your judgement, and you are not infallible - rather the Church of Jesus Christ is (see 1 Timothy 3.15). More subjective feelings. This is not a proof of anything more than one persons feelings. As I have written time and again, the Hebrew canon was fixed in Jamnia, Palestine, in 90 AD. 60 years after the foundation of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. Furthermore, the opinons of Jerome do not count. He was neither the Church, or the Pope, or an ecumenical council, or a council in general, or an insturment of the Magisterium of the Church. He was a private individual, learned admittedly, but subject to erro of opinion. And in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he erred, as Pope Damsus, and the Council of Carthage, and the tradition of the Fathers, clearly shows, as I pointed out in my previous post. I suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want to take it in the sense you are taking it, that taking away from the book will cause you to lose heaven. The order of the Canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters. None of Jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were interspersed throughout the canon. And remeber, there are some completely undisputed books, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiatses, Song of Songs, Job, etc. that are not quoted in the New Testament, which is not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.	15
Regarding the consequences of the original sin: Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace. This is basically a share in the Divine life. Take a rock and make it able to talk: what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar. It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature. This is the "everlasting life" that the New Testament speaks of. What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race. He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people, and its increase fostered. The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven. The nature of Heaven is such that it's impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace. To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk. Neither can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace. This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since both have souls. Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot enter into Heaven. They too need this form of life in them, or they cannot enter into Heaven. Turning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the Catholic belief in sanctifying grace. Unless Baptism causes some change in an infant's soul, there is no particular reason to insist on the practice. Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the Apostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly thereafter.	15
I don't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not. Certainly they *can*, as the example of John in utero proves. I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ, which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ's cricumcision which we, in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh. Also, perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism, which can be independant of faith, from the experience of rising with Christ by faith. Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their baptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless. Like the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience. Baptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of God. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy. Do you teach a child to pray the Lord's prayer? Do you expect them to not steal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition. And in the new covenant, we shall no longer say: know the lord, for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest Heb 8:11. But also according to Ezekiel 18, God will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense. Thus Jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam, *IF* that's what ezekiel is talking about. Shall you make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well? > Ezekiel 36:25-26 indicates that this new heart will be given by God, in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. It is the action of God puting them into his new order, and not a question of"personal" faith as such. But the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death, but the dead state (originbal sin). We are in a covenant of death, because adam, our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death. While this psalm is figurative in it's language, it is not hyperbolic, and the one does not necessarily imply the other. There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm. What v 5 is likely refering to is what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God). The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual (hyssop, cleansing, burnt offering, etc) David's sin with bathsheba included this element, as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have. But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was passed generationally. That's why the organ of generation had to be cut. That's why brith was unclean. Uncleanness was death, and all babies were born dead, and needed to be washed to newness of life, which we have in baptism today.	15
I agree, with the exception that I don't preach ignoring our cultures. In Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one congregation in each major city. So there was one unified church. Now in each city, there were people of different cultures. Naturally, they formed something of a stew, with different members having different heritages. Nevertheless, they were ONE body. They met together, sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts. Now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a common language associated with that region. For instance, in Rome, Latin was spoken. In the United States today, English is spoken. So it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily Latin. Naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language. In the first century church, there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups. Today, however, you don't see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called Pentacostal churches. We do have a modern day equivalent though -- bi-lingual speakers. Now in the unified church of which I am a member - sometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet together on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue. Neat idea, huh? Now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays, so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish- speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language. In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals. So someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those meetings. As for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities. The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of Latin? Indeed not! See my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article. However, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted. I'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping. You have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't. Yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality "Christian" friendships outside your nationality (and your denomination). We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage. However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples. It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going about things in the wrong way. And names like the African Methodist Episcopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before. I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite. I know that it's hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to make it happen. However, what might be a smaller step towards unity, would be taking the word "African" out of your denomination's name. Then perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "Methodist Episcopal" part also, and simply be part of "the Church". There shall be one church, for the sake of unity, AND it shall be useful in helping students new to America make the transition in culture, language, and thought. We shouldn't make a new denomination to try to solve problems. The whole denominational mindset only causes more problems, sadly. Thank you for the invitation. That shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage. Thank you also for responding to my post. I know (all too well) how they can be very time-consuming. The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions, but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time. My own church, the Boston church, has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post, yet doesn't limit expression of my Mexican culture, even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish (speaking) Zone. I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the Sunday services of my church, because I know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples. I don't believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because of my understanding of Biblical Christianity. However, I am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with my normal worship. Since you also live in Cambridge, I also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like. You can meet the MIT students at the Student Center (across from 77 Mass. Ave.) at 9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day. My number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer. Our service normally last from 10AM to noon, but occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year). Definitely! Let's also strive to grow in obedience to the Lord through being men and women after God's own heart.	15
I am going to stop reading the homosexuality posts, at least for a while, because of the repeated seemingly personal attacks on me via post/e-mail(mainly e-mail). If anyone has a specific comment, suggestion, and/or note that does not contain any name calling, etc. that they would like for me to read, send it to me via e-mail. I would like a copy of file mentioned by the moderator ragarding the exergetical issue of it. I attempted to get it via ftp but was unable.	15
[To the moderator: I posted this about a week ago but it never showed up (locally) on the net. If this has already actually been posted, please fill free to flush this copy. --N] From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) 1] A english translation of this can be found in: "The Acts of the Apostles, translated from the Codex Bezae, with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance", J. M. Wilson (London, 1923). 2] Another work that might be useful is: "The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933; reprinted 1970). (This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic. I don't know if it actually contains an english translation or not.) 3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is: "The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966). 4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s. (I can supply the reference if anyone's interested.) 5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find. So if you're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in: "A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT", Bruce Metzger (United Bible Society, 1971). Metzger's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT. It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3. Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts). "[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full report (with an English translation) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings." (p 272). 6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter (or Alexandrian) version. The longer version to which you refer is usually called the "Western" version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources). 7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark's edition (mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains 18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%. 8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. The main difference seems to "expansion" of detail in the Western text (or, if you prefer "contractions" in the Alexandrian). The Western text seems to be given to more detail. There are some interesting specific cases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail. 9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy. If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents purely the "authentic" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the "better" more often than not.	15
: : In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters. In Rom : 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. : Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about : idolatry. Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at : least result, of idolatry. There are a number of arguments over this : passage. It does not use the word "homosexuality", and it is referring : to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. : So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.

[material deleted] [deletions] I don't necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it, since I see no Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy. But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices "parallel" Mormon temple ceremonies. Could you give an example? Also, why do they only parallel Mormon ceremonies? Why don't Mormon ceremonies restore the original Christian practices? Wasn't that the whole point of Joseph Smith's stated mission?	15
Early in Church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration of the Eucharist. It WAS secret, giving rise to the rumors that Christians were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims. The actions were considered too holy to be observed by non-Christians, as well as potentially dangerous for the individual Christian who might be identified. Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --	15
I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues, however, a couple of them seem as though they do not require "incredibly perverse interpretations" in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality. "... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you..." I Cor. 6:9-11. Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God? How does this apply to homosexuals? I understand "fornication" to be sex outside of marriage. Is this an accurate definition? Is there any such thing as same-sex marriage in the Bible? My understanding has always been that the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife. I am, however, willing to listen to Scriptural evidence to the contrary. "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination. Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion." Lev. 18:22-23. I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. I know of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn, or even mention, intercourse with animals. Do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a perversion, and if so, why? That is, what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful? Could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently? Can one be a Christian zoophile? By the way, I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful, so please understand that I am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow "people of alternative orientations". I do believe, however, that one should read the Bible with an attitude of "what is the Bible trying to say" and not "what do I WANT the Bible to say." I choose not to give in to my "perverted" sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me, whether I like it or not, that such things are sin. It is frustrating at times, and I have had days where it really got me down, but I don't blame God for this, I blame the sin itself. - Mark [There's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote. Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that "homosexual" is not the general term for homosexuals, but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute. That doesn't meant that I think all the Biblical evidence vanishes, but the nature of the evidence is such that you can't just quote one verse and solve things. I think your argument from fornication is circular. Why is homosexuality wrong? Because it's fornication. Why is it fornication? Because they're not married. Why aren't they married? Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony. Why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony? Because homosexuality is wrong. In order to break the circle there's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong.	15

I'm very grateful for scott's reflections on this oft-quoted phrase. Could someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it? (Rom. 12.9 doesn't count, kids.)

Surprise, surprise. I sure didn't lose any sleep over it, and I live there. Suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death, in glory and power, flying in the clouds with the host of heaven,soon, within the lifetimes of those then standing with him - and 2000 years went by without any such event. [He also asserted, so they say, himself to be God.] 2 questions: 1) Is that one of those "false prophecies" you were talking about? 2) Does that make the speaker a false prophet? Uhh, Has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these things, for certain, "without the tiniest shadow of a doubt"? That people who thought they did have also been deluded? Those of us who believe in actually being able to _CHECK_ our opinions have an out - we can check against some external reality. Those who assert that beliefs entertained without evidence, or even despite evidence have a special virtue (ie. "faith") are out of luck -- and this is the result. You want to demonstrate Christian honesty? Great. Start with the prophecy above - what can we conclude about the speaker?	15

This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus` time, that Elijah would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die). However Jesus was referring to John the Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John (remember Elijah didn`t die) but that John was a similar prophet to Elijah. John was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom. The verses that describe him (in Mark`s gospel) can be linked to OT references about Elijah. Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering Servant in Isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself. A brief reply but I don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff. Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.

If I get a chance I will ask them this weekend. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem. A "quick look" doesn't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point. The clash between Jeremiah and the "false prophets" was primarily in the theological realm. The "false prophets" understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant, which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's descendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies. The "judgement prophesies" were deeply loaded with theological meaning. In my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson "New York will burn" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies. -- ___ Bill Rea (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---	15
I'm about to revise my resume and was wondering if I should put on there the fact that I'm a Christian. Give me some input on what you think.	15
Several replies to my post have said that I should get to know Christian homosexuals before judging them. I maintain that I was not judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong. I would like to look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical evaluation of the people who responded to the side of Christianity and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals but I know that many are from their e-mail responces). I don't normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but since I have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point I will. So far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because I don't have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling. If you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you who are homosexual Christians show me the diffrence.	15
[Anyway, your argument seems to be saying, "If _I_ were God, I certainly wouldn't do things that way; therefore, God doesn't do things that way."]	15

Ouch, this is a good question. To me, not existing is worse than existing no matter what, so I will modify this question to be: would I be a Christian if it made no eternal difference in my reward or punishment? I hope this is in the same spirit you want. I personally am very goal oriented. It is hard for me to do things that do not achieve some goal. However, to relate this to sports, only after I learned to not care about the score did I become a good basketball player. I had to learn to go all out no matter the situation. Perhaps this lesson is relevent. After all, only if I can give up my life can I keep it, only if I am humble can I achieve glory. Only if I concentrate on living my life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal. I think you have illuminated the true meaning of "saved by faith." But what is my answer? Right now I would remain a Christian. However, was that always my answer? That's the problem. Heaven and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity. And I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day, i.e. I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness. I hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that than appropriate, but I am trying to be honest. I think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. I guess it depends on how one views knowledge and learning. By stripping ideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can determine levels of importance. By analyzing the theoretically absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.	15
[Someone quoted the following. I've removed the name because it's not clear which name goes with which level of quote. --clh] On the basis of these examples I would say that Joe Moore was only wrong in claiming Augustine as a prime mover of the sin=sex view. These quotes clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance, even within the marriage relationship (else they would not apply to Mary after her marriage to Joseph). So Joe's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual virginity of Mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.	15
I have enrolled in "The History of Christianity" at a college here in St. Louis. The teacher of the class is what I consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of Christianity is. His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic church's definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one's self a Christian. While his saying it doesn't make it so, I nevertheless feel insulted (or am I just neurotic? :^) ). I would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship. So, is there common definition of what Christianity is? As the previous discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange of flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major flames. Regards, -- Larry Autry Silicon Graphics, St. Louis autry@sgi.com [Often we get into discussions about who is Christian. Unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions. Starting from the broadest, commonly used definitions are: a historical definition people who accept Christ as Lord and savior a broad doctrinal definition narrow doctrinal definitions 1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular historian would likely use. This would include any group that developed out of the Christian church, and continues within the same broad culture. E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with. Yet it's clear that that group developed from Christianity, and people from very different backgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of Christianity. This is not a definition most Christians like, but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts. 2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many Christian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and Presbyterian Church (USA). I would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit. It's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine. By this definition, groups such as Arians would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians. In the modern context this would include Mormons, JW's, and "oneness Pentecostals". They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christian. In practice I believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the Apostle's Creed. 3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition, which includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes groups that are felt to be outside "historic Christianity." This is of course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that Protestants are outside historic Christianity, etc. But I think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon. The attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree are key. Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement. A Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs. But I think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance. 4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited to a specific Christian tradition. E.g. some evangelicals only consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience, and some I've even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church. I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used. A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you're using it for. If you're using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you'll probably use definition 1 or 2. If you're using it normatively, i.e. to say what you believe the Christian message is, you'll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4.	15
The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in any way. Since God knows everything, He therefore knows everything that is going to happen to us. We have free will, and are able to change what happens to us. However, since God knows everything, He knows all the choices we will make "in advance" (God is not subject to time). Too often arguments pit predestination against free will. We believe in both.	15

This has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with. From a long article Available through an individual on this newsgroup. About scripture being against homosexuality: ------------------------------------------ When we are less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian people, engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't even mentioned. [in the Bible, tk] ------------------------------------------ This frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually), especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church. So, if my interpretation is different than theirs, I am homophobic! This can't be right. Disagreement in interpretation of the Bible and/or rejection of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.	15

Woo! So far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of the `Whore of Babylon' in Rev 17 & 18: a) The United States of America b) MHO dB) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who corrupt and oppress human society c) Historical Jerusalem d) Historical Rome Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? How about * The prophecy reveals God's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people (d) * That God's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that City's special call, it still rejected God's grace at the decisive time (Rev 11:8? - also isn't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem?) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon (a) and is equally subject to God's judgement * That the Good Book(TM) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created. (b) Clever, huh? (<-- Flame here!) No need to argue at all! I think Mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by God's grace. eg Details like Rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem `the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.'	15
This is something I've always found a little curious. I've never quite understood the trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But, at the same time, he is God's son "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could he really be God's son? If the Holy Ghost "planted the seed" in Mary, so to speak, then it seems that Jesus' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that case, Jesus and God aren't the same. On the other hand, if their relationship isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God incarnate, then he's not really God's son and he never was. He's just God manifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I'm seeing it. Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body may have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more. The fact that Jesus was God's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my sincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ. But, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious. [Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together. First, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one. (In this group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.) You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God's son in a physical sense, with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother. I consider that terrible heresy, though some people react less violently. The Virgin Birth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility. But it doesn't imply that God's sperm was involved. Indeed one (though by no means the only) speculation is that God used Joseph's genetic material. Second, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father. In a Trinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is a part of God. The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth. Jesus is the incarnation of the Son. So his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated. Rather, it's the Son who was incarnated.	15
The dogma of the Assumption does not state whether or not Mary died a physical death before being taken into Heaven. Catholics are free to believe what they wish, whether it be that she was taken still alive, or after having died. I lean somewhat toward the latter myself.	15
The Catholic church has an entirely different view of Mary than do "most" other Christian churches (those with parallel beliefs notwithstanding). Christ, by most accounts, is the only sinless person to ever live. I too, have trouble with a sinless Mary concept just. As for the related issue of the "original" sin - only Adam and Eve will answer for that one. My children do not answer for my sins, certainly I only answer for mine.	15
On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God. To quote Unger's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms. 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture. 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture. 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling. First, to point out the obvious: While #4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue, one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the OT (or for that matter the NT) that doesn't, on some issues, in some way, fail one or more of the first three of these tests. Second, one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition. I don't recall the exact dating of all of the books, but most --if not all-- were written after the latest of the canonical books (i.e. Daniel). Furthermore, while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in Greek, they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in nature. Both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons. These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books, but, as these discussions have shown, I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity.	15

Hypostasis [I've explained it here before. If you want the full document, ask me by mail --Rex] "Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner consciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ briefly. The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability. This would mean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death, free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation. In the realm of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which was not absolute-and in Himself. The result of the incarnation was that the divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die, not in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human nature. This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the human nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the person. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited power, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries. There is, however, no penetration of one nature into the other. Deity can no more share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the Godhead. We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the possession of the double natures. Christ's human nature is impersonal, in that it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the God-man. We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the Man. Nature is defined: "the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental character, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and unchangeable." Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such the Trinity have one nature. There is also a common nature of mankind. Personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the power of consciousness and will. It is for this reason that the human nature of Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal. LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality. It is equally important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as such, belong to the nature. It is for this reason that we can justifiably say that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one. It is theanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will are simply human or simply divine." [The quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely clear to me what position Loren is taking on it. Just for clarity, let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic Christological heresies -- monothelitism. That's the position that Christ's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one will. In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the human will that was regarded as missing. Normally people who talk about Christ's human nature as being "impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense. That is, they are using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of personality. In this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia". Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the Logos took on humanity fully. However it has never been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius). But the quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went, into the realm of the overtly heretical.	15
The Moderator of the General Assembly, the Rev. John Fife, visited our church about a week ago (just 4 days after Rev. Spahr--it's been a busy week for our small church!!). He was asked specifically about the issue of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the GA meeting next month. Evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range the gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" it completely. He will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult issue that the church has had to deal with since the Presbyterian church split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago. Without question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited for all of a dozen years or so. He is hopeful that it will not and is pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion issue last year as a solution. He is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the members of the church "Agree to Disagree" on the issue, admitting that both sides have honestly studied the Scriptures and had the Spirit lead them to different conclusions. It worked last year when the abortion issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that the GA can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree with their own view. -- Cliff Slaughterbeck | Dept. of Physics, FM-15 | It's time for the sermon on the University of Washington | Grand Torino!

> Paul repeatedly talks about the "thorn" in his side. Some think > it refers to lust, others pride, but who knows? Whatever the > thorn was, apparently it was not compatible with Christianity, > yet does that make his epistles any less? Paul mentions his "thorn" (SKOLOPS, actually a sharp stake) in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9 + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of + revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of + Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated. Three + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me; + but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my + power is made perfectr in weakness." He does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral problem. One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He ordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and his signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says, "See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand," or else, "See what a long letter I have written with my own hand." If the former translation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters larger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the Galatians (4:13-15), + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. Perhaps this last line means simply, "You would have done anything for me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes)." But in that case, we would expect some wording like, "If I had needed them." "If it were possible" sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes. William Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific suggestion. Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had a malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.	15
It's always a two-way street. God gave her the grace to avoid sin, thus when she was visited by Gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total acceptance of God's will. This fiat summarizes why Catholics regard her as the highest of all humans, that God chose her and that she accepted. Knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was neither stained by nor subject to original sin. God did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin. "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of God to command it." This amount of grace was precisely determined by God to be the amount required to do what God asked of her. The grace given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose to accept it. We also believe Jesus was fully human and never sinned. God could have created a much better person than myself, one who always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite my flaws. He proves he loves me as I am, continually drawing me towards perfection. For whatever purpose he has for me, he has confidence that I will accomplish it. If I ask God to repeat his miraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me?	15

The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were (or are) monophysite is false, as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon was Nestorian. These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors, and thus led to schism - a schism that is on its way to being healed.	15
continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission, THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING OF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY James B. DeYoung W. Petersen More recently Wright's understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction. In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic confusion in using the English word "homosexuals" as the meaning of arsenokoitai.[22] He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for rendering it by "homosexuals" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10. In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey. He finds "homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic. "A major disjunction" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in Paul's time (187-88). What is this "disjunction"? He bases it on historical and linguistic facts. Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. Christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" in describing these actions. Ancient society know nothing of the categories of "homosexuals" and "heterosexuals," and assumed that, in the words of Dover quoted approvingly by Petersen, "everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . ." (188). [23] In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term "homosexual" to desire and propensity. K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term equivalent to "homosexual," used it as referring to orientation, impluse or affectional preference and having "nothing to do with sexual acts" (189). Petersen then proceeds to cite the "Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary," which defines "homosexual" only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts. Petersen's point is that by using "homosexuals" for arsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history "where no equivalent concept existed" (189). Consequently the translation is inaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes female homosexuals" (19=89). Prior to 1869 there was no "cognitive structure, either inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence" (189). The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio "homosexual" is mistaken. Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one mistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds? The next phases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING ARSENOKOITAI BY "HOMOSEXUALS" Historical Grounds A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" begins with the historical and cultural evidence. Since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul's usage, no historical settings earlier than his are available. Yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with Paul. The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to present-day concepts. Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual condition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be part of the definition of the term. They assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; Scroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times (Bailey; Petersen). The following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate. Attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under "Linguistic Grounds." In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the homosexual condition exist before 1869? Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if it is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including ancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. Indeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of same-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex orientation or condition. Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in "Symposium" (189d-192d) may be a "sole possible exception" to ancient ingnorance of this condition. He discounts this, however, believing that even here "acts appear to be the deciding factor." However, this is a very significant exception, hardly worthy of being called "an exception," because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition. THe "Symposium" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition. [24] Plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman"). Hence "original nature" palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings. Zeus sliced these human beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods. Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex. Plato then quotes Aristophances: Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two; and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him. All the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are woman-courters; our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex, whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses. All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men: they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions. Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men's embrasces; these are the finest boys and striplings, for they have the most manly nature. Some say they are shameless creatures, but falsely: for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome their like. Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men. So when they come to man's estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom; they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days. A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind. Well, when one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be induced to leave each other's side for a single moment. These are they who continue together throughout life, though they could not even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25] Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each "would unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all the time: (192e). Several observations about this text are in order. Lesbianism is contemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e). "Natural interest" (ton noun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. The words, "born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: (paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims "to be born this," i.e., as homosexual. The idea of mutuallity ("the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love," 192b) is present. Aristophanes even speaks of "mutual love ingrained in mankind reassembling our early estate" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai tes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency ("These are they who continue together throughout life," 102c) is also present. Further mention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, "gay pride," pederasty, homophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is recognizable. Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from actions. THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is crucial; money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e). There are tow kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion" (186b-d). The speakers discuss the principles or "matters" of love (187c), the desires of love (192c) and being "males by nature" (193c). Noteworthy is the speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is related to love and its objects (200a-201c). Desire is felt for "what is not provided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack." This is the object of desire and love. Socrates clearly distinguishes between "what sort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e). This ancient philosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature. His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26] In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato. Petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not inclination or orientation. Widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter. [27] Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction. In Rom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desires of the heart." and "reprobate mind" prove Paul's concern for disposition and inclination along with the "doing" or "working" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). Even the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor 6:9-11) by words describing what people "are" or "were," not what they "do." Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt. 23:28). The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise to the other (cf. Mt 5:27). Petersen errs regarding other particulars too. Transvestism apparently was accepted by the ancients. It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian, people of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28] Only a few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it. For example, Seneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an adult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman. Philo also goes to some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women (The Special Laws III, 37-41; see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he justifies prohibition of cross-dressing). Even the OT forbade the interchange of clothing between the sexes (Deut 22:5). Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the "new labels" of "natural" and "unnatural" for sexual behavior. These did not begin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even non-Christian contemporaries used them. Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu, Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29] Linguistic Grounds	15
It's my understanding that Romans 9:13 "As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated." refers not to the two individuals, but rather to their offspring, the tribe of Jacob and the tribe of Esau See Obadiah, for example. In fact, if you scan through the OT, you will find similar references to the two tribes.	15

[ in response to a question about why Jesus' parents would be sanctified beyond normal humanity] I would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the Almighty God would be enough to make Mary blessed among all women, whether or not she had special spiritual attributes. I find that the more special Mary needs to be, the less human Jesus gets.	15
I have no problem with the idea that catechumens be dismissed before the Eucharist. They were not considered qualified to participate. Does the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a secret? I mean, was it: you don't have to stay; from now on, only the membership can participate; you really don't have to hang around; yes, I know you're obliged to keep up attendance to qualify, but now is an exception, okay? or was it: you may not stay; what happens next is secret When we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church, we've made it clear that only members can vote. But we've always been happy for non-members to stay and observe. Do you have evidence for intentional secrecy? (Other than rumours, which will always happen when you have an underclass doing things not approved of by those in power?)	15
If that's the ONLY reason, I'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what they profess is Christianity. The relationship of faith is based upon trust. Fear and trust are generally incompatible. If my only motivation is fear, is there room for trust? If so, there's room for faith. If fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith. Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com) --	15
... If we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from speaking in church. Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could err. I find it interesting that CHRIST never discussed the issue of homosexuality, certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious transgression CHRIST would have condemned it. I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying to stamp out something that CHRIST didn't consider worth a single word of condemnation. CHRIST repeatedly warns us against judgement. Don't we risk "judgement in equal measure" when we condemn people who GOD himself did not judge when he walked on the earth? -- | The love of CHRIST is contagious! --+-- |	15
Thanks for the letter, your comments helped some. As to the last comment, I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that way. I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same time. All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of, "they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are one, trust me"). Neither of these is acceptible to me. The fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any *sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as Modalistic Monarchianism or "Economic Trinitarianism". [I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God, so I perhaps lean more towards the latter]. I am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and believable. -- sarima@teradata.com (formerly tdatirv!sarima) or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com	15
What we call today the "Old Testament" was being written up to approx- imately 168 BCE, according to most modern scholars. Aside from the book of Daniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great). These books were written (predominantly) in Hebrew. There were also other books being written at about this time and later by Greek-speaking, or "Hellenistic", Jews. These books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as "Apocrypha". Before the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today called the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day. However, there were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased. This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day. They also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from God. By the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess. Christians had come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship. Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach) onward were not sacred writings. They justified this from Zech. 13. In particular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were not inspired. At about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia. A few books (Ecclesi- astes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben Sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian and Hellenistic writings. Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by Jews of his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his time. His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings was not based on 'inspiration'.	15
"Hate the sin but love the sinner"...I've heard that quite a bit recently, .... My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not. Hate begets more hate, never love. .... In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors. He doesn't say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. .... - Scott I too dislike the phrase "Hate the sin, love the sinner". Maybe the definite article is also part of the problem, since it seems to give us license to fixate on our brother's peculiar pecadillo which we have managed to escape by a common grace of heredity, economic situation, or culture. Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot. That said, I don't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side of this coin, namely the love of righteousness. In the Beatitudes, Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness. In the New Testament, it is never enough just to behave well, one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good. In that sense, it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its victims, even when these are its accomplices as well. Maybe "mourn sin, love sinners" catches the idea slightly better than "hate", but only slightly, since grief usually implies a passive powerless position. A balanced Christian response needs grief, love, and carefully measured, constructive anger. Jesus has all three. The European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was devoid of anger do not fare well as role models, however much love or grief they exemplified. My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian. A few years back, Jack, her long-time professional friend and benefactor, died of AIDS, impoverished by medical bills, estranged from his family, and abandoned by most of his surviving friends. Only my sister and brother-in-law were there with him at the very end. In her grief over Jack's death, my sister found quite a few targets for anger: callous bureaucracies, the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack's family, the inertia in Christians' response to AIDS, and, yes, even Jack's own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life. Jack himself shared that last anger. Brought up with strong Christian values, he was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his AIDS appeared. (I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's innate sexual orientation, n.b.) Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.	15
All children are born pure, i.e., without sin. However, most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning. (Some church members would be much more judgmental, but that is *their* problem.) In situations where welfare assistance is provided through our Church, bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the Gospel standards and provide for themselves. However, there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home. As a former bishop of mine said, "Children are always worthy before God." I am not sure what you mean by the term "bastards" in this context. Latter-Day Saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity. If you use genealogical material or software produced by the Church, you may notice a section for "temple ordinances." Within that section there should be a spot for signifying "BIC" which stands for "born in the covenant." The children born to couple sealed (married) within the temple are "born in the covenant" and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit. Children born to other couples (whether in a civil marriage or not) would have to be sealed to their parents after their marriage is solemnized for eternity. Supposing a child were born to a woman out of wedlock, he or she could be sealed to his or her parents at a later date or adopted into any eternal family unit (which may include one of the birth parents). I can't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances, but it has been accepted for the ~15 years I have been in the Church. I would tend to discount any admonitions from the Church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the Lord's plan to recover what we have done wrong the Church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure.	15
[my stuff about dealing with defferences deleted] i am sorry; i did not mean to. i think i understand how your experiences were much worse than the small bit of ridicule i have had to put up with. i guess i didn't really understand before; now i do. wow, pretty conservative church. (please excuse me if this seems like a ridiculous understatement to you.) (on a side note, that "under God" wasn't in there until recently -- i believe my father, who is in his sixties, remembers saying the pledge of allegiance without that in there. i don't know the history behind that though.) emotional blackmail -- ouch. thank goodness (i'll be neutral in my thanks here :) ) i was raised in a completely tolerant household, so that i could make my own decisions! so atheism doesn't have to be taught, but christianity does. i guess i can see that, although i can see a child believing in some sort of god without anything other than his/ her own imagination as a basis. (sorry, i guess this is sort of minor) [my query about parallel between lack of choice for homosexuals and lack of choice for him as an atheist deleted] hmm, i wonder why i am a christian then? this isn't a flame, this is a real wonder. does anyone else have opinions to offer on why you believe in something that hasn't necessarily been "proven" to you? sounds like you are an atheist by nature, then. or is it possible that at least part of it is due to the apparently repressive nature of the christianity of your childhood? if this is getting too personal perhaps you should ignore it, or we can take it to email. this may have been a general remark; you do not sound broken to me, but indeed stronger. yes, i agree with that. i've seen some of the damage repressive religion can do, and as a result i intend to raise my own children as much as i can to look around before accepting one religious stand (atheism is included in this) and to _question everything_ -- this is very important. i can see that.	15
You are quite confident that essences do not exist. How do propose to define beings? Can a thing can be *one* without definition? Can a being have a definition and know essence? What about properties? Do beings have properties? Does God have properties? Does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them? See my post in alt.messianic about the possibilities of tri-theism from a phiolosophical point of view.	15
Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems. In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual fantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never do in real life. I understand the need to control ones thoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free, no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.) Is this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions, I could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by experiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not. I can't believe that other people don't do the same. It seems silly to attach moral significance to dreams. I think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences, which I have never had. Contradictions welcome.	15
I would say only to the extent that the Roman Catholic Church neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment, as confirmed in the recent catechism, though there are many RCs who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was not explicitly condemned. For myself, as a Catholic, I see my own opposition to capital punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a reverence for life. Here in the UK, the anti-abortion case is often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti-abortionists and pro-executionists. There is a tendency to condemn people who hold both views as hypocrites. I feel that if there were many more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro-life line, it would end this kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing, and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing reason). I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken as support for capital punishment. I take it that as a Roman Catholic you are opposed to abortion, and would still onsider it wrong, and something to be objected to even if legalised by "authority".	15

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort. She had to ask the 'Lady' several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so. For several instances, the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any. One time, after several apparitions passed, The Lady finally said, "I am the Immaculate Conception". So, Bernadette, was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking. So, when she told the priest, the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette, "Do you know what you are talking about?". Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest. The priest continued with, "How did you remember this if you do not know?". Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then. But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette. (Note: This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims.

.. ... It sounds like she has a problem. She has a problem opening up to her husband so she is lesbian. WHAT? In a marrige, a couple is supposed to open up to each other. Because she didn't feel comfortable opening up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that she is lesbian. Before anyone gets maried they should make sure that they would feel comfortable "open up the deepest part of her soul to her husband". "Sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole relationship." Did she think it was diffrent with a man. That might be her problem.	15
In <May.13.02.31.16.1993.1569@geneva.rutgers.edu> djohnson@cs.ucsd.edu I'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious. Try rephrasing it: What's more important to Christians? Love of God or love of other human beings? to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other. I am *deeply* suspicious of any "flavor" of Christianity which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a "priority" over the other such as to claim a conflict. True, we are told to let the dead bury the dead, to "hate" family rather than let it keep us from following Christ. But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us to the presense of God. It is particularly satanic to twist love of God in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in "love" of God. The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex. Yes, it has sometimes been the case that the Church has "taught" that all sex was nasty, evil, sinful stuff. But when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming "one flesh" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)). Less provocatively, what I mean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their children's mothers. This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus' citation of that passage.) [ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as I have just described; but another thing that characterizes human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ] Yes, of course it sometimes goes "wrong" -- like all else we do, it is infected with sin, and you find married "couples" where there is no bond, and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation (the "infatuation", "falling in love" phase) that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away. Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love -- but in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God's grace under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil is watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.) So, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT Christians? Sex, or Christianity? Paul, clearly, tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable to him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the "proper" preparation for an immediate eschaton. Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together. And telling people *not* to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love. I would claim that only a very few saints have the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication, mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in the type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship. We are human, and little good comes of trying to "mortify the flesh" to the point of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings. It depends entirely on context. If that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us "stumbling blocks" I am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins. There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift, and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin. Nothing I say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift. Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics, and indeed for all God's creation, that can develop to the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded in sex. But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance; telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?) is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from God. To one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet another prophecy; and to still another teaching. The notion that some *particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.	15

This idea, that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the Bible to the people in their own language, is a myth. Many vernacular translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation. The Vulgate Bible, which is still the official version of the Bible for the Catholic Church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar == vulgate) tongue of its day, Latin, and had existed for about a millenium before the Reformation. It might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented until the same century as that in which the Reformation occurred.	15
[does he believe in predestination] really? you may be right, but i'd like proof. as far as i know (and i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination. my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions! i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute. right. that doesn't really seem like predestination to me, but i'll continue with what you're saying.... this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for ALL of us. preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses. but then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i? others? so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed and not where it isn't? and so there are the saved and the not-saved, and nothing in between. hmmmm. although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to be some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell. in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth. that's almost like the converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die. you're saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now? strange.... so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both? what if it's sort of half-punished? are there any grey areas in this doctrine?

[...etc...] I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul's illustration about one body / many parts far too narrowly. It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity (generally our own), and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. There is a place for that. But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine - Catholic, Protestant, liberal, conservative, Orthodox, etc. - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the 'body of Christ.' And I am equally sure that one day, after we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth. We ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called. One of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name) put it quite succiently: In essentials, unity. In nonessentials, liberty. In all things, charity. While I agree with Lewis (Mere Christianity) that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all, I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. Me? I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an inerrantist, though I'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately pre-mill, and evangelical. But, I'm not ready to damn those who use icons, say mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don't believe that she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for salvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth - why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth? But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word, and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter. --T.S.

I would just like to point out that the particular command not to eat or fellowship with Gentiles is not found in the Old Testament. This was part of the "hedge built around the law." It was a part of Peter's tradition, and not the Scripture.	15
Not to change the subject, but how was Fr. Gobbi allowed at Notre Dame? Notre Dame is an anti Catholic University. Was this allowed to show that the crackpots at Notre Dame believe in freedom of speech? I am glad that they did allow him to speak.	15
In a post of 29 April (?), considering disasters as instances of the judgements of God in history, Andy Byler spoke of > the desire of the Jerusalem mob who crucified the Lord that > "His blood be upon us." Vera Noyes replied (02 May), > I will not comment here for fear of being heavily flamed. I invite them both (and other interested parties as well) to read my comments on this verse of Scripture. To obtain them, send the message GET CHOOSING BARABBAS to LISTSERV@ASUACAD.BITNET or to LISTSERV@ASUVM.INRE.ASU.EDU. Putting it briefly, I think that the significance of the demands of the Jerusalem crowd has usually been greatly misunderstood, both by Christian and by anti-Christian readers. Yours, James Kiefer	15
This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is _not_ in the Bible, then it _must not_ be done. But I don't really think that's what he's saying anyway. See below. What about the letter to Philemon? In it Paul at least hints that a certain slave be released. Also, slavery in those times was not the same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S. I think a better comparison would be to indentured servitude. I don't really want to get into a discussion on slavery. Anyway, although it does demonstrate your point, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not immoral. Back to the original poster's assertion. He is not in fact making the logical error of which you accuse him. He stated the fact that the Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized. Also, we know that the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. _Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the contrary, i.e. an exception. Since there is no exception listed in the Bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven. And so we baptize infants. To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something is not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if something cannot be disproven, it is true. He rather seemed to be asserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_, using the Bible, that it is _not_ OK. There is a difference between proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are theories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually proving or disproving it. The other logical error we must avoid falling into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is false. This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers. I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism, although the evidence seems to me to favor it.	15

When it's too windy to stand. When you're on the road in high winds, stay alert. Even more alert than your "alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill you" kind of alert. Be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel wind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but it's gusty 'cause you ride through it). If you are riding in a steady crosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your lean angle. Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave their turbulance cone. Reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the gas tank and kiss the triple clamp. Keep a nimble hand on the steering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts. Keep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the side, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by countersteering. Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if someone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early. Stop often for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally and physically fatiguing.	8

Hi there kids and kidlets... It your ol' pal the KotPM (Keeper of the Pin Money!) I've got good new and bad news... Good news - I got laid..er... The pins will be coming, to use the computer software phrase, "real soon now" Bad news - Right after we placed our order, the company upped its minimum order for manufacturing. We got in under the wire (with an order of 115 or so pins), but as a result of the low number of pins, we were relegated to the "we'll get to it in-between other runs" bin. As a result, it seems that it may be another 4 or 5 weeks until your beloved Geeky is guiding you along the blacktop.. (And we thought madonnas on the dashboard were foolish; hmmm, now, if that were Madonna sitting on my dashboard, that could be DANGEROUS...hell. I'm tough.) SO...please continue to be patient. As soon as they arrive, I'll post the grand announcement, and rush our Messiah on his way directly to your abode. In the meantime, if you need revised versions of the holy word of Geeky, please send $15.95 cash or money order (no COD's) to: Ranch Apocalyp...er......Ashram Geeky, 305 Cyberspace Place...

An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja. Owww. Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well... I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started riding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes. The passenger seats are not designed for long rides. The passenger positions aren't even usually designed for short rides. I ended up torturing my knees and my back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes. One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had a BMW. :) I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains or some such. Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there. The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger: - Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off. After I get on the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off. - Keep your feet on the pegs at all times. Don't wiggle (unless your rider asks you to :) - The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive. Echo the movements and lean of your rider. Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable, but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn. - Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders: use a reasonably consistent shifting style). Avoid "helmet bonk." Helmet bonk is when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers. It gets old real fast. - When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank. Putting your hands on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain, but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there. - Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're still there. :) The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider. - Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or losing feeling in your feet. Passenger seats are not generally designed for comfort. Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.	8

I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car production. And, I seem to remember, that the main problem with the Elan was caused by GM's insistence that the Elan be re-designed (significantly) for the US market which caused major design & production headaches. Quite true - brain fade on my part.	8

Is (was? :-( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth? I've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. I found I was overdoing it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again, I tried with Vice-Grips. No, not the usual Grip Of Death technique, I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit. A couple of iterations and I had just the right amount of Zipper Squish (TM). I've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit (actually on the Accessory Ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge. I don't know what brand of zippers HG uses, but parts ARE available for YKK's plastic zippers. Replacement was pretty simple, just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end. Slide on the new zipper pull. Then crimp on (Vice-Grips again!) a replacement zipper stop. You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts. Oh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the Eclipse tankbag are also YKK.	8
For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's UPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV. The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the sand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean. As far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can tell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order it if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories always seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots from them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was about $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a completely unreasonable question: "Do you have them in stock?" The conversation went something like this: I need to know if you have some boots in stock. Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard? I want to know if you have them in stock. Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the distributer to find out if we have them. So do you have them or not? Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not. Uh, right. So can you do it? Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil. So an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call him back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either, but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month (3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock: Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock, but I'll check. What size? Size 10. Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black... I'll take the blacks! This was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once again, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral. I'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be prepared to wait. Oh, and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff, Scorcher seems like a good outfit, friendly, fast, had the tires I wanted in stock, and were cheaper than Chaparral too.	8

You could, but it would be considerably cheaper to spend $8 or so on a trickle charger from K-Mart, Venture, or Target, then it would be to replace the halogen lamp power supply after you fuse it trying to pump current into the battery...

Doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it? In fact, if we riders need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from Lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back to party some more year after year. You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these "lesser indiscretions". If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the "indiscretions" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the "indiscretions" don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults. The only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place. If I lived there and the bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation and good intentions, I'd certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed. If it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who needs to "permit" or "justify" it? You? Why do *you* need to do that? Ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe. They've developed a friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general population because of it. If such a need exists, it surely must come from within. Well, you got the "self-righteous wusses" part right, anyway. Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com	8

WARNING WARNING MAY CAUSE UNPLEASANTNESS! It's a "make before break" type of switch. If not required, it ought to be for high-low beams. There might be a wee problem with this. If you use both filaments at the same time, the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal. Possibly enough to shorten it's life span. My Honda CRX cage [a cage that really wanted to be a bike] had wimpy stock lights. So we used to run around with both beams on. Made a mucho big difference - until both low beam filaments died nearly simultaneously! This was two weeks after finding out how nice it was to use both beams. I replaced the lights with quartz-halogen lights and that ended the problem.	8
Be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the mirror. It will depress the foam liner in the helmet. That is not the kind of foam that bounces back, like foam rubber. Its purpose in life is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin. If your mirror compresses it, there is that much less energy absorbing capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash. I found the right handlebar to be a good spot, if on the sidestand. Hang with the chinbar facing up, balanced across the grip and brake lever such that the weight of the helmet doesn't compress any of the chinbar foam. This is more challanging with an open face helmet.	8
But you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm. All you need to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit. This isn't quite as silly as it sounds. If you take a nice day trip over back roads (*not* highways full of people trying seriously to get from here to there) then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably. You could easily do 500 miles over three different weekends. You might even get to enjoy some of the scenery. Yes, I know this is probably not why you bought a 250 called "Ninja."	8

i saw this posted and it brings an interesting event to mind ..... a few weeks ago i was in the DMV with ken. i was standing in a mile long line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of people from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid about 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time. i didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching our helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of platforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he touched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid "YOU STAY AWAY FROM THOSE YOU SHIT!" and whopped the tyke brutally about the head and shoulders.	8

Nice ridin' Tex. I use the California DMV recommended technique: slow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass. I've often contemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as I open the throttle, but have never tried that. I figgure the impact would unballance me and I'd dump the bike. A bicycling technique I've employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog attacks. On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at once while peddaling up a steep hill. I lost my right sock, but no blood. I complained to the local Animal Control department (after complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs; no more dogs, no more attacks. The telephone worked much better than the tire pump.	8
Greetings all, Can anyone let me know status of UK law about riding motorcycles. I used to ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One of a whole list of things I wished I had done when I was young),but I have passed my car driving test. I now travel from Littlehampton to Brighton every day and I'm getting PISSED off with the traffic/road works. I thinking about getting a 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just to get "Streetwise" and to take my test, then to get a bigger one ( 400 to 600 cc ). Now I have been told I don't have to do the CBT but what will I have to do to get a full licence ? Thanks in advanced Leigh	8

I'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the GS550B and, I think, the GT380M) I was able to pop a Cibie' insert directly into the original housing (held in by those roughly W-shaped springs). The inserts used 55/60W halogen bulbs, and were great, although Mr Bill later indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.	8

If you had been looking in your mirror, you would have seen the guy coming before you heard the screeching tires. When you're stopped at a light: 1) Stop so that you're got space in front of you, and a quick easy escape route (between lanes, into a crosswalk, up a driveway, somewhere) if someone decides they want to plow into you. 2) Keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars are stopped behind you, so you don't have to waste a second you don't have trying to get it in gear if you need to move. 3) Watch your mirrors. In that situation, most of the hazards you are trying to avoid are coming from behind you. SIPDE (<-- msf-geek-speak) isn't just for when you're moving. And you're less likely to panic and stall the bike if you've got time to prepare before the guy's tires lock up behind you.

I would stongly recommend a factory service manual, and if you are not an experienced machanic then get a chiltons or haynes (sp?) ALSO. Make sure the bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run. Read the books and if you have more questions you could mail me. Also, be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts. They take very little torque and breaking one is disaster.	8

The local BMW dealer will give you details of the BMW Insurance terms and the club will help you with all details. Getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can afford it.

David Gibbs replies: I guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike turns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front wheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about 90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the bike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember which way. -Rick Oh yeah, I tried this in the driveway, on the centestand,(as suggested somewhere else) but it doesn't seem to work the same.	8
Okay, here's what to do. Get a drill and a sanding disk. Use, say a 100 disk and go at it at a very low rpm. If you don't have a drill, try coarse steel wool and brake fluid.

Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop. I've only been riding for about two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival: - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car. If I have to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the car in front of me. If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my visibility to any oncoming vehicle. Make sure to keep your taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE: My bike is bright white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.) - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually about two or three bike lengths). This will (hopefully) give me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches. - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors *constantly!* If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out of the way *now!* - Flicker your brake light. If I'm the last vehicle in line, I will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-). I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice that there's something in the lane ahead of him. Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line that I feel most defenseless. If you're first in line, your forward escape route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that you don't enter the intersection. I leave some room behind the stop line (although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors. I *think* I've decided that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation. Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind you? -rob.	8
Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean. Say you want to turn left. You push your body off to the left. To do this, you have to push against something, and the only thing to push against is the ground (through the bike). Well, the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the ground will push you right back. So, you pushed yourself off to the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground pushed back toward the left. Well, that push is on both wheels. The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), but the front wheel has trail. If the ground pushes the front wheel toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the wheel to turn to the right. Hey, there we are. No-hands counter- steering.	8
So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you know, strap a generator to my FZJRR11000KRX and route its output to the chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is pretty nice and all, but, I'd still like to be able to blow away a Goldwing without going to nitro...	8
A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger: There's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes I used to ride in the UK it was hard ! I'm now riding a GS1100 and that's great, even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently. This may be due in part to the fact that neither I, nor my regular passengers, are particularly slimline ! I always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes their movements predictable. My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all, I don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods. Again that may be biased by the fact that I've had a couple of new passengers (a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight, making any kind of maneuvering difficult. I've also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and shifts their weight a bit. I recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also sitting very still and getting a sore back. We have a code system for turns, stop and for 'I need to shift position'.	8

Hi. I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable. They are. There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the locking head notch in. Thus, each link is a possible locking point. Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at- cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally functional. Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights. I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur. (I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away). My first post. What did I do wrong :)? sang DoD #0846 '80 CX500 p.s. any other CX500 owners out there? Please e-mail me. Got questions about the weird handling on my bike.	8

To follow-up, I had a bad experience w/ a Krypto Lock too... Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II (3/8"x3-4' long, something like that) that by all standards seemed like a decent piece. Until I used it anyway... Before I ever used it for security purposes, I used it for entertainment (minds out of the gutter, please), which is to say that I sat fiddling w/ it while watching TV (the night I got it). After three minutes of mindless fiddling (of course it was mindless, remember I was watching TV) the entire tumbler mechanism came out on the key! Not unlike that old Georgie-porgie nursery rhyme. This left a very empty cylinder and a very non-secure (read "swingin' in the breeze") cable lock. Kinda makes me wonder about any flat key-style lock. One yank w/ a slide-hammer and Viola-- I'm making an insurance claim. Anyone else have a similar experience (w/ the Kryptos, not bike theft)?	8
you may have been able to bounce the front up but not actually do a "wheelie". see the shaft effect unloads the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front. this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts scraping in a corner......	8

Well, apparently once you get past about 6 inches, all the luggage shifts back in the panniers, the passenger slides back, and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack, and they go all the way over until it's flat on it's ass, with the front wheel straight up in the sky.

Actually, a WERA racer, William Lumsden, considered running a Vmax in A Superstock. He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day, and _really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a sideways Vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd blow by down the straight (usually wobbling). Needless to say, since he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F, he decided against the Vmax. Too bad.	8

Also known as, "leaning." [severely confused rambling about the ground pushing...] Contersteering refers to pushing the inside handlebar to effect a lean. No-hands countersteering is an oxymoron.	8
If the clutch is in, then a large chunk of counter-rotating mass is not rotating. Hence, at a light, reving makes it twist. Shaft effect is the rear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road when the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads are real close to the road). New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have almost no shaft effect. It's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the extra light. At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much if at all. The alternators put out sufficient wattage, it just that you need to be at 4K RPM to get it. Full choke. Open the gas taps. Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the throttle. It should fire. Cranking should be done with minimal throttle. My R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle. It's an EXPERIENCE thing. Like Zen, it's hard to describe. It can be hard to learn if you aren't paying atttention to the differences between success and failure. Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the battery while trying to get it to run. If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks, I give it a short while to start. If it doesn't, I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off. I've got dual plugs which make it easier to start. The BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit. It's good for a few MPG and the parts are alcohol proof. The parts it replaces aren't alcohol proof. As long as the bike isn't going to sit for long periods of time, gasohol is nice since it helps keep ping away. If your bike doesn't ping on cheap gas you ought to raise the compression! (Half a smiley, the BMW twins of the 80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy. Dual plugs and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).	8
There was a guy around here who would do them on an early pre fairing Wing with a Hannigan. He would get it right up and ride a ways. Pretty intimidating sight. He was real good. He had to be. I guess you wouldn't get away with chopping the throttle more than once. __ Jorg Klinger | GSXR1100 | If you only new who Arch. & Eng. Services |"Lost Horizons" CR500 | I think I am. UManitoba, Man.

My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run. A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. He kicked the dog a couple of times (we were all only going about 10-15mph) and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly. At the time, I had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell) and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike, I pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog's ears hurt like hell) and he didn't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either. My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog. I wasn't paying very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass. I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. Both wheels went squarely over the dog's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4 lumber. The bike didn't lose any stability at all and I kept on going. After I got to my destination, I found bits of fur, meat, and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.	8
man, every time this thread comes up, i start jumping up and down screaming ' EASY WHEELS!

Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today. Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the ride was very zen. Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work on her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got home. Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said "to heck with it" and drove my cage back up. Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes into the trip. And me in my cage. Oh JOY. Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the bike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but annoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing them this afternoon. 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned "2 D-Cell Flashlight" headlight.	8
If possible, I split lanes. Even if you don't get all the way to the head of the line, at least you won't rear-ended. I always worry more when I'm in the lane, at the front of the line, and no one in behind me. Then you have to keep an eye on your mirrors. I also get ready to pull a hard right, *just in case*.

Now, while I wouldn't recommend doing this while moving, (Maybe Mike Beaverton can complain to you awhile! :/ ) you might not want to countersteer if you're just sitting in the driveway... <sounds of Rick falling off bike, muttering, "Damn, coulda sworn that's how they told me in the MSF course!!?" >	8
A few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to be available thru BMW. The idea was that the tape would look black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to headlights. It sounded like a nice way to add nighttime visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction. I talked to the local BMW dealer about this. I was told that the only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being used in a coming line of BMW clothing (rainsuits). He wasn't aware of anything regarding self applied tape. Has anyone come across this from BMW or any other source? Thanks,	8
We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day: the closer I got to those exposed fangs (still dripping, no doubt, with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become. Also, recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger. The other ~5 lb is, of course, dog poop, but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended lawns of the dog's owner's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply, no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me). My very thought at the time, but as I looked down at these once formidable instruments of mayhem, I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard. There was only one option left: I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench, surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one. To my amazement and confusion, the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass, then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street, still quivering and occasionally looking back at me. "Seven at One Blow!" I exclaimed, flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile. It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along: the wrench was defective, would no longer measure torque accurately, and Sears wouldn't fix it or replace it. What I had interpreted as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt. Exactly: nobody can look quite as silly as we can.	8

It is a little known fact that a dog will involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. I was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and force it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become momentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really pissed. OOOOOOOpsssss.

No, the Grand canyon is not too far away. Short side trips to Kolob (between Cedar City and Hurricane) and Pipe Springs (on the way from Hurricane to the Grand Canyon) may be interesting--they are right off the highway. Pipe Springs (a small fort) gives you real insight into just how the pioneers lived. You have missed one major must see attraction--Cedar Breaks in the mountains above cedar city. Take lots of film--they have a reason for calling this kodachrome country. Natural Bridges in the four corners area is also very scenic, but may be too far off your route. Monument valley is spectacular, but again may be too far away.	8

It is heavy, the 91 is mid 600's dry, that is the one major drawback of the ST. Can you say " tourque monster" The test drive sold me on the bike, lot's of bite anywhere above 2500 in any gear. Did you trythe ABS/TCS version? After market fairing windshield for 100.00 raises the bubble 6 inches above most heads, but hurts the looks of the bike. This is the essence of the bike, move the throttle and itr accelerates any gear anywhere anytime, I frequently find myself at the DOD min during a casual passing maneuver. This is a function of the weight, you have to be aggresive with the brake squeze, actually as tested by Cycle world and an expert rider the ST stopped faster then the comparable models from BMW, and YAMAHA even with the extra weight and Gas . You must countersteer the ST for every turn and movement short of the classic pothole wiggle. Just forget ever leaning into a turn again. It must be countersteered into every turn and then responds nicely. Faster then I've ever gone, I 'd hate to buy this bike after your short "break in period" Not true, the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold the bike nicely on dirt. I am able to easily get the bike up on the center stand, just step down on the stand instead of pulling up on the bike.	8

]it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists ]unless, of course, the existing list failed to meet the readers' ]needs. nowhere did I see you mention K bikes, which, being made by BMW, are welcome on my list. in fact, you go out of your way to say: "most all boxer talk is welcome" your list appears to cater to boxers. that's great. my list caters to BMW's, *without any restrictions* like you have. considering that the subscription count went to 29 within 18 hours of my initial post about the list (which was made around 10:00pm just before I went to bed), I'd say that there is a need for a *BMW* list as opposed to just a GS boxer list. my motivation for setting up the BMW list came from an earlier post of yours announcing your boxer list. it didn't fit my needs. ok, we've pissed on each other's list. let's get back to the regular net.noise and read our respective lists.	8
Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order. The were aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the grip itself. Wires ran outside of the bars, from the grips to a switch and finaly the battery. Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them. Dunno if they are still made. Might check with the snowmobile racers. ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT. Student =====----	8

After failing my State of New Hampshire Noise Gestapo test with my HD Slash cut pipes I installed my new Bubs (which I had been planning to do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no problem at about 97 dB. Two points: First, I don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. Holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced the dB level! So if any other NH riders need to get this done, make sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from the body. Second, these Bub pipes are bloody terrific. At low revs or cruising through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats a more throaty, purring, rumble. When you open her up to >3000 RPM they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. Best of both worlds!	8
Hello Folks, I'm very happy with my "new" R80GS. My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons... that's 50 mpg!! Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser. I was expecting something rough. She's a sweet backroad honey. And I can go pretty much anyplace I'd take my mountain bike. As far as shaft effect, it's more a torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. Rev it sitting still (when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. Maybe I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence. Okay, here are my questions: 1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing? I'd like to keep the wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds (70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my vision too much for trail riding. Anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings? I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas. 2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar. The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.) Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day. But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much. Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM? 3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning. I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section of the paper, and then she starts right up. Is this a Zen thing? 4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives... Yeah, right. What do you folks due to keep the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol? Any particular brands of gas that are best? Additives? Thanks,	8
On a related note (since UPS lost my Chain Wax and I'm still using PJ-1/Goo), I found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels. It's called Goo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple Green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight. Wonderful stuff. I recommend that we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge (tm) product.	8

I bought a Yamaha XS850 with 8K miles. Over the last 2 years, I've put 30K of commute miles onnit. Valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every 5K. Well every 7.5K or so, I've checked the pad clearences, and they never change! If anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right? I know that threaded adjusters can tighten up, but I didn't think these kind could.	8
Countersteering is a method for *leaning* the bike. Another method is leaning. Once leaned, the bike turns all by itself.	8
I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend. I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma. At the side of the road, sitting off on the shoulder was the killer Volvo in question. No brake lights, no turn signal, nothing. We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front of me about 2.5-3 sec. back. Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around... So I get on the brakes in a effort to not T-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up. As she finishes the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending stare. Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR? Dean	8

I did. Regularly. And it was. Michael	8
Are you sure? Harley's disclaimer says, "if you crash, we take care of the bike, you take care of you." If you were really responsible for the bike, did your insurance cover it?	8
Because I'm a guy and most of my pillions are female. Also, the other reasons, like having an idea where you passengers weight is, it being a more comfortable position for the passenger, and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well. Holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking, when you don't want the pillion to slide forward into you, otherwise I don't find it works well.	8
Absolutely. Early XS1100's were VERY good at this. Don't try it on your Virago unless you already are purty good at it or like the smell of exploded clutch. -- Go fast. Take chances.	8
: To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips: : What are they like during the summer? Yes, you : wiseguy, I mean while they are off! : Are they comfortable? Do they transmit a lot of : vibration? How do they compare to the stock grips? : To foam grips? : Do they really make a difference during the winter? I just got a K75 and had the heated grips installed. As far as I can tell the grips look and feel the same as the standard grips. They are *not* soft. Last weekend I did a 500 mile round-trip and got to a point where it was in the 30s and raining. Those heated grips were *great*. I've only had the bike a month and the heated grips are already one of my favorite features on the bike.	8

Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago, and since I don't read many schematics, I didn't really think aobut it too much. Yes it does provide excellent coverage, but I figured it would probably draw a little too much current. I also figured that it was overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight. Are you saying that these switches are designed for the hi/lo combination? ------------------------------------------------------------------------	8

A friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new Yamaha Virago 750. After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen the brake pedal, &c. &c.) I've pretty much decided never to get this particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter for me. Compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his Honda, this is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.	8
No, it is more because van drivers need a little support for driving such underpowered pathetic and truly utilitarian vehicles.

Sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a Virago. I've owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed. Obviously the "new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on. Watching for imitators!!	8
[...] Aw, c'mon. The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points, not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish. I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames. The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat. This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining. While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends, dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short. The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and boring. (Witness the Infante thread recently....) The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has a few weaknesses as well. In the first place, it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other. In the second, discussing someone's personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. (Or is that slanderous? I can never remember the difference.) This leads to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING. Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic. I can't haul my big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general. In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect. While it may be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable. You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning. The same goes for anyone who looks like you, too. ----- Tommy McGuire mcguire@cs.utexas.edu mcguire@austin.ibm.com	8

Well... all the way through a decreasing-radius corner, anyway... OK (but I'm right!) :^) If that's the "official line" taught in those rider education classes you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, I have to question the quality of the classes. The "official line" in MSF curricula is as I described. Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift. The "official line" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it. Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0. Not necessarily true. "Chirping" the tire indicates impending lockup (on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking. I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use. True, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills (which is how this discussion started), "keep both wheels just on the point of sliding" is nearly useless information. You need to teach a *technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.	8
Knight Riders has got to be one of the silliest movies I've ever seen.	8
Because, unlike the UK, passing the average driving test over here usually only requires a pulse & a single digit IQ. Every state controls their own licensing requirements, so it's possible that there's a test out there that actually requires some driving skills, but I doubt it.	8
I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment straps. Most come with 3 and some with 4, I have a Bagman 4 strap tankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit is not optimal.	8
It does! I do it to keep people off my ass. They really back away when they see canon fire rolling out the back of a Harley.	8

Well, just got all the parts replaced that needed replced (sprokets+chain) and notice that engine still taps like it did before. All our local 'experts' say it's the tappits that need some adjusting so I am soon to attempt that. I would like any advice anyone had. I do not have a shop manual but have read about the procedure in Chiltons and in a few other places. Is there anything I need to be particularaly carful of? Any problems anyone else has encountered?

In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap that is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination of information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that I would post this one, which came to me yesterday. This is from board member Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse. This is NOT my words, O.K. guys? April 4, 1993 re: Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick: We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year. Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws. In pertinent part, the rules state: "Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length. Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task. Had Cecil's statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with the word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement. As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president. This does not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the process. I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election. Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences. With kind regards, I remain, Robert Higdon	8
joe, i'm sorry you felt i was pissing on your list. no disparagement was intended and i would be most interested to know what i said that made you feel that way. i am not suggesting that your list is superflous nor that it will not serve a need. i just would like not to see the boxer contingent split, but there is certainly enough net for more than one list. -- -- bob pasker -- rbp@netcom.com	8

Spike is owned by both Tom and I. We went 1/2's on the purchase price and have split costs of needed parts, registration, etc. Both names are on the pink slip. I am covered by insurance to ride the Harley. I'd give it a go if I could work the clutch. I can barely get the clutch lever to move using both hands while standing next to the bike. Ol' Sport is a very distinctive bike. The Concours is favorite of mine. I've pillioned an easy 4000 miles on that bike in the last year. Unfortunately, my feet are a good 10" off the ground once I'm on her. No way I could take her for a ride as pilot rather than pillion. If I could fit on a Concours, I'd buy one. IMHO, the best sport-tourer made. I'm not _too_ upset I had to settle for the Ducati 750SS as my touring bike, though. :-) So, now you know. Beth	8

This summer (~July 20) my wife (Michelle) and I will be in Boston attending my brother's wedding. After the wedding we are planning to motor up to Bar Harbor, Maine to visit some relatives for a few days. Our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes) to borrow or rent to ride up to Bar Harbor and back. Here's some important details: I've been riding for ~11 years, (my own bikes for the past 7 years), Michelle has been riding for the past 6 years (her own bikes), I've only been involved in one accident which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, I currently own a BMW R90, Michelle owns a Yamaha Virago 700, we prefer cruising over racing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured, and we're nice people. So, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have to be a Virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in July, Michelle and I would be eternally grateful. In addition to our friendship, you would also have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through Minneapolis. In exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner and an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or something. Also, any information about bike rentals in the Boston area would be greatly appreciated.	8

I just installed a MC Power Arc II, and it seems to run great. I also used MC coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC. A little soldering and all was fine. Static timing was real easy to set too. On the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks MC Power Arc is a "piece of shit" and says "all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day". Needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and recommends the Dyna-S system. I think that's the one with the Hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?	8
I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad, but I doubt that they are THAT bad. I've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but, my 82 Maxim 750 will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch. Admittedly, it is easier with someone on back, maybe that's what keeps the rear tyre down. ;-)	8
Thats pretty hard since CB900 customs weren't introduced until 1980. If you find a pre-80 one, hold onto it. It will be worth big bucks some day. Mine has comstar wheels. Methinks you need to do your homework better. And obviously, neither do you.	8

And DoDers are easily recognized by their own special wave. Pay attention and I'll tell you how to do it. Hold your left hand out in front of you, fingers straight but apart - like a vase. You may also use your right hand if you have a throttle lock or are stopped. Bring your fingertips and thumb together, touch, and open back to the starting position. While you are doing this, move your hand slowly to the left. Do it gracefully and with a waving motion. You are now imitating a squid propelling itself about underwater probably in search of food, drink, squids of the appropriate sexual orientation, or other squids to go riding with.	8
& & If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have & the same question. Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the & adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run & off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? & Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are & measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims? Only buy what you need. It would cost a lot to buy a full set, and you won't ever use most of them. I have had good luck with the calculation method. I have never had to change more than one size increment at a time (I never needed a change larger than the next size up/down, usually down). They cost a few $ each for a Yamaha.	8

No, it is the stock setup. Someone really ought to put an end to the confusion regarding BMW's chain drive boxers. Didn't someone post the FAQ on this some time ago? In essence, it describes the problem BMW is having with their decision to settle down to a shaft drive as a standard. They vacilate and persist in reintroducing the chain drive in various models. (R/C) Gosh. Well, on with the crusade!	8

I knew when I posted that I was going to get into trouble. Now I suppose I have to give /5 wheelie demos at the Spring Fling or something. But you're right, John, it is a chain drive model.

Oh yeah, all the time. On a nice spring/summer day, I roll down the window and drive around looking for bikes. When a bike motors by in the opposite direction, I stick my arm out and hi5'em. My arm feels like a million bucks when I'm doing this a 60km/h. I do the same thing with cyclists. The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane. I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back. Oh well, I think they appreciate the thought. Regards, Ted.	8
In response to Jerry Lotto's post about not putting your helmet on your mirror or else risk damaging the padding from the inside. One of the major causes of mirror breakage is impact with the pavement. Laws mandating that all mirrors be protected by helmets might be in order. But seriously... One place to put a helmet is on a, preferably clean, footpeg, hanging from the chin-guard, away from any hot pipes.	8

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer, I'll supply one. Yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering. Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to occur to the left. It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight. (Ok, so my motorcycle is heavy. Maybe yous isn't.)	8
If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, I have the same question. Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? Obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims? Chris	8

; I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle, and to ;put it bluntly, it sucks. I really would like some advice on what would ;be a good starter bike for me. I do know one thing however, I need to ;make my first bike a good one, because buying a second any time soon is ;out of the question. I am specifically interested in racing bikes, (CBR ;600 F2, GSX-R 750). I know that this may sound kind of crazy ;considering that I've never had a bike before, but I am responsible, a ;fast learner, and in love. Responsible and in love? I believe that's a contradiction in terms. Unless you're really brave (read: "reckless") a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding. Getting more than that really is overkill, as you'll never even want to use it. The following bikes can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice to manage, and are plenty high performance: Kawasaki EX-500 Honda VF-500 "Interceptor" Suzuki GS-550E The 0-100mph time of the EX-500 at full throttle is "way sooner than you're ready for it". :-) With something as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly (unless it's a TZR or RGV :). Now, I'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR-750. Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine. What I am saying is that it's a waste of money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping. You'll never get the throttle more than half open anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?	8

Me too, though unfortunately the "Official Line" is the one that you have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. The examiner's guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education courses have no choice but to follow them. It surprises me that none of the rider groups here, either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which I can't think of for the moment. If the riding test could be rejigged a bit to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures would (imho) reduce still further. Don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...	8

Now, in keeping with the grand tradition of wreck.moto, let's mutate! Take your partners by the hand... On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours (when I -should- have been working) with a torch, brazing bits of scrap metal over the biggest holes in Yamadog's exhaust pipes (s'mazin' what you can do with a couple of AA cells and a three-volt bulb!). I stuck some "gun-gum" into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike. So, last night I'm on the way home when lo' an' bloody behold, the sodding thing starts blowing again. I check it out and the gas is escaping from around the clamp holding the number two pipe into the port. As far as I can see (it being somewhat "hole of Calcutta" at the time!), the nuts are still there (stop that bloody sniggering, you at the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose. This morning I go out to the bike and pull out the socket-set to tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that spotty kid at the back a good slap round the back of the head!), and lo' an' bloody behold a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel. So, I stuff in a bit of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best "gun-gum" and come to work (late again!) so that I can ask of the oracle... Will a brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port? Anybody tried it? Oh, and if anybody can tell me what the differences are between a 205 and a 207 brazing rod (made by "Gaz" [Yup! the camping folks. Surprised the marmalade outa' me, too!] in that place just off the Isle of Wight) I'd be eternally grateful (twenty-sodding-quid for two rods and I don't even know what I'm buying.

Good advice. My Ol'lady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is uncomfortable. I, in turn, am prepared for her to move about on the back of the bike. We had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest of hill on pavement/pea-gravel road) and her actions helped lessen the severity of it. As we were crashing, she stayed upright in the saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist. I was able to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided. She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc remove a lot of rocks from my knee. Had she panicked we would have probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury. BTW, as soon at the tire went flat, we went into VIOLENT tank- slappers. This is what she rode out in a "normal" riding posture! ----===== DoD #8177 = Technician(Dr. Speed) .NOT. Student =====----	8

About a year and half ago when I first started riding, I took a MSF course. I have taken those lessons to heart. Over the past year I have had only a few near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels. Yesterday I got to add another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless. I am sitting at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion. Suddenly I hear screeching tires. I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the bike. Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.	8

Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back. The most beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook. Though this is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly recommend it. IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon. It was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was heading north from Monticello). In order to get to the right place, I should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation area. Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may have been marked as the Anticline Overlook. Anticline overlook is about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles overlook. The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably maintained (I ran it about 70mph). Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on the world. If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.	8

Not to start *another* shaft effect discussion, but the twist you feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly-wheels that the BMW R-bikes (maybe K's too, dunno) use.

I have a '72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago (I upgraded to an '84 Sabre 750). I parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned on draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store. Well, after a lot of procrastination, all I ended up doing was throwing a tarp on it. Well, now I have to move and want to clean up the 350. I tried starting it (with someone else's battery) and had no luck. My first guess is that it is the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (I can only pray that I didn't trash the carbeurators). The question is, what do I do with this old gas? I am not going to run it in my Sabre, and I think that there is enough that I don't want to burn it (campus police don't think too kindly about bonfires). Dumping it isn't a great idea.

I need help getting my ZX-11 (C3) to behave. I've managed to get the front suspension to be very happy, but the rear sucks. I can't do anything with it to make it feel ok. The bike is very stable through the corners (I think because I have the front just right), but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous. It feels like it actually amplifies the bumps. And the damping doesn't seem to do anything in real-life, although you can tell the difference when the bike isn't moving. I've tried 4-5 cm of sag (from completeley unloaded), but I don't know which way to go. Has anyone gotten the rear of this bike comfortable? And if so, what kind of settings (esp. what sag) did you use. I like to corner, but I also would like my kidneys to remain intact. This thing makes the new ZX-7 feel comfy....	8

I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well. However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. That is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I can hold speed. If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops drastically. Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000 rpm. The top third/half of the throttle range is dead. Standing still the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K). Other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the engine becomes a little wavery. That is, at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down slightly. The bike has about 13000 miles on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk. I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance. I'm hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth the hassle of any major engine work. Thanks,	8

One point not yet mentioned: Hands on the driver's shoulders are a definite no-no. It feels good for the passenger to stretch her arms, and a shoulder massage feels good too, but the shoulders are connected to the arms, and the arms to the handlebars... Should you hit the brakes, the pressure on the shoulders can make steering interesting. Bundle her up if it's cold, make sure she has good gear (say it again), an pat her thigh to let her know all is great.	8

The FT-500 is a good beginner's bike with: * a reasonable seating position * enough power to get you up and around, but not so much it'll scare the bejeebers out of you * tips over well, and easy to pick up (don't ask) * simple maintenance I've had mine for four or so years, and haven't had any serious problems with it. I bought it used for $750 with about 8000 miles on it. Just last week, someone in the neighborhood stopped by to ask me about it; whether I thought it was a good beginner's bike, is it comfortable and powerful enough, blah blah blah... Seems he found one used for < $500 with about 3600 miles on it. The reall "trick" mod I've heard was to take the front end from a 600 hurricane and slide it in. This was from a guy who campaigns two Ascots in SOS racing. He says they do pretty well too, once you strip off the starter, lights and other assorted street paraphernalia, its a pretty fast and light bike.	8
I've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent experience passengering with Dave Edmondson at pilot while in London. I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot, that is, if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on hard for braking or acceleration. I tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible, leaving Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and luggage. Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to fight. Similarly, I held on to the grab handles tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (I'm a lot bigger than he is...). Reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to manage. On the rare occasions when I carry a passenger myself, I absolutely refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. That's helmet, jacket, gloves, stout pants and shoes/boots as a minimum. It's not my responsibility to provide this gear, but it's my responsibility to require it if they want to ride. And I agree with an earlier poster: if you've not had much experience carrying a particular passenger and especially if you've not carried many passengers before, take a few gentler rides of some duration before you head off to a difficult road like Mines/Mt. Hamilton. That's a nasty place to find yourself in trouble.	8
since at least one other person was interested in this: my FZR's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired. yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand. sprayed on paint. thought about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that i wouldn't be at all suprised if the paint wore/chipped off in a month. soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder coating, while extremely durable, will not handle over ~600 degree temperatures. the place i talked to said they were experimenting with some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldn't be available for months at least. they directed me to another shop that specializes in header coating. the other shop said they have 2 coatings available. one is aluminized that can do 1200+ degrees and is "comparable" to powder coating for durability. the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800+ degrees (!) but is thinner and not as durable. both coatings have a textured finish (not super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush. price for 4 1-foot header pipes and a 2-foot 4-2-1 collector was ~$100. i'm planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (UPS) next week maybe wednesday. sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap/rocks.	8

Automatic revocation of your license for a year. I'm not sure it's the "toughtest" law around, but NC has absolutely no sense of humor with respect to driving laws, anyway. I think they put you in jail and sell your first child into slavery for passing a school bus... A bill breezed through the NC House to lower the intoxification level from .1 to .08. It faces stiff opposition in the Senate. Recently, the Highway Patrol took a few of the opposition Senators out and gave them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging cones. They failed, and will probably change their votes as a result. For some bizarre reason, NC is the only state where the governer has no veto power over legislation coming out of the state Congress, so his opinion on the matter is moot.	8

My fiancee' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up. I'll tell you what we've found and the systems we've worked out. - On starts, accelerate MUCH slower than usual. It's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast acceleration is, because we're holding onto something and leaning forward. Remember this. - On turns, have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally this means she isn't leaning at all.) It's very disconcerting to be leaned over and have your passenger leaning so that they're sitting straight up. Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous. - On slowing and stopping, do so MUCH slower than usual. Again, it's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is, because we're holding onto something and leaning forward. However, you'll figure it out fast because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you, which shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location. - Generally, have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike, not out wide. This helps balance and gives her somegrip. - When you passenger is in fear, she will squeeze her knees against you. Normally this means "slow down, and do it now!". We only have a couple signals. "Slow down" is her either tapping me on the back, or slapping my helmet with all her might. Depends on the urgency of the matter :-) "Turn here" is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit. This is also the sign for "cool! Look at that." "I hafta pee" is the same sign as "turn here". "I'm hungry" is the same sign. "Go faster" is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee. I usually see "slow down" more often than "go faster". The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy, and pillion on his or her bike. It's incredibly frustrating, because you're in almost no control. Now, multiply that feeling times ten, because you as a rider know what your bike will do, and your passenger will likely feel you're about to scrape hard parts all the time, or lock up the brakes at any moment, or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain, etc. Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad. Also, remember that it's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up than by yourself, because you're concentrating on much more, and "in the Zen of the moment" less. Remember this. ---------------------------------------------------- Pat Loughery [patlo@microsoft.com] Seattle, WA DoD #393, AMA, VME, DIOC, 1KSI=2.53 '91 VFR750F, '91 Nighthawk 750, '82 Seca 650 Turbo ^^^ For Sale	8

And I don't : know if I'm being subjective or what, but it seems like the bike runs : better ! : Run your bike on the lowest octane that it will run smoothly on. Higher octane fuel is not "better" than lower octane gas. Pick up the last American Roadracing magazine.

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means "slow down". Seriously, concentrate on being very smooth, and you will make her experience much more enjoyable. Even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob, so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this. It's more work, but your passenger will appreciate it! Also, I've found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops, which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on. If you're going sport riding, have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your arms. (Again your bike will dive less too)	8

Just one little thing. Last year, mid-december, a cop pulled me over. It was about -10 Centigrade, and it just started snowing (O.K. you are right, I live in Canada). The cop checked my license, insurance, ownership, looked at my frozen nose and fingers, told me to watch the speed limit more closely, and, entering his cruiser, told me, I was doing 68 instead of 50 km/h. Didn't ticket me, and I REALLY slowed down after that ( I already mentioned it started to snow. ) Safe riding, Stefan. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------	8

My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle, in other words, I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down for few millimetres to each direction. This doesn't bother me when riding, but I guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. Last summer I took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job. All I would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find there. Well, upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. It seems that, in addition to removing the cover, I would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket. Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (Don't know the exact term in english, sorry) ? Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose ? Does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ? Thanks !	8

I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the screeching.	8

Another F2 rider had similiar problems, and this is the mail I sent him, hope this helps resolve you problem! AT Good point, did not catch this in the original post. The only other things which come to mind, since this is a gravity feed fuel system, is this. The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the #1 carburator. Let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. When it is cold, the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on, since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas, and as the engine and surrounding area warm up, the hole seals up. One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. Connect a tube of the correct size, preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow, on the output side of the fuel petcock. Remove the control hose from #1 carburator. Make sure the tank is full. Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose, preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge, to check for air leaks. With vacuum applied, fuel should flow freely. To see if there is a vent problem, do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed, if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open, then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent. I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem. So the things which might be defective are, the control hose from #1 carb, the petcock valve, and possibly the fuel tank vent. Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold, then there is something in the carbs screwed up, but there are so many things to check, I would be typing all day to list them all! Here are a few, with everything back together, apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs, there are quite a few on each carb. I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. If American Honda does not resolve this, get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE. It is a 800 number, but I don't recall it off the top of my head. I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received, here would be your chance to tell them what you think!	8

HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55 It's simple. First, it has to be the first really nice riding day of spring. The bike is back together again, and so are you. Grab all your gear, put it on, and fill the tank with 94 octane premium or better. Head out. In Ames, there is a road that leads to the little town of Gilbert. Gilbert has one stop light, if that tells you something. Having just gotten the bike back together, I thought I'd take it for a short ride and check things out. Heading out of town, I went into the twisties at a slow pace, just under the speed limit, and started leaning around. The pace quickened as everything felt just right. Finally, the road straightened and I was ready for a bit of speed. Grab third gear, open her up. At roughly 90mph grab fourth gear. Look at as much of the bike as you can, and fail to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind. Twist the throttle like a fool, grab fifth gear at 130 or so, and see just how well she's been put back together. At 146 (according to radar) I noticed the front fender was flexing a bit. Thus, I slowed, pulled off the road, removed my helmet and gloves, unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny pack, and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper pulled in all hot and flustered. "Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going?" "Not precisely, no. I was paying attention to the bike and road, not the instruments. I just got her back together last night, and I'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic." "My radar says you were at over 145mph. Care to tell me why I shouldn't give you a ticket?" "Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and traffic, on a strait and flat road, while wearing all the protective gear that safety demands?" (note: I wasn't quite that eloquent) "Say, what kind of bike is that, anyway?" <I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750, a Rat Bike> "Yeah, I haven't had my bike out of the garage in years." <compare riding stories> <pack toolkit, having tightened that fender> "So why were you out here?" "I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through me. If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone, I'm dead. If it holds up out here, then I know it will work right in traffic. I do this evvery year when I rebuild her." "Not any more. You'll find a better place than *my* highway to do those speeds. If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway again I'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can. Now get out of my sight before I write you a ticket." "Yes, officer." "And kid, keep your eyes open out there..." <drives off> And that, in a nut-shell, is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55. I don't guarantee that it will work for you, but it worked for me.	8

Unable to stand the pain anymore, my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT. It came with no instructions, but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would. Installation would have been very easy, but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat! It never was easy to put on. Once I figured that out, the new seat went on the first try. The passenger backrest, though, does not fit as I thought it might. The supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit, and I have not yet found a suitable, hard, ( SAE grade 8, or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits. There is a a soft bolt in there now -- just don't lean back. The driver's section of the seat is a bit wider. Seems comfortable enough, but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought. The passenger's section has about 8 times the volume of foam that the stock seat has, and from my short test it seems much more comfortable. The backrest helps a bit, but I've not has enough time to really test it. The backrest also comes with a small pocket. Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 10" taller seat. If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville, Pinkham & Smugglers), I'll give a more complete report, but in general it seems like an improvement.	8

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front, but enough to manuver around it. Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you. When the next BDI cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side of the car in front of you. You don't need to panic and do it, or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine. Do is smoothly, just rapidly. The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection than anything else (particularly empty road).	8

We'll be riding some twisty, }fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans). Unless she is really adventurous, do NOT take her on this route for her first extended ride! That's kinda like taking someone on a no-show 10-way speed star competition as their first skydive. }This person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so I don't see weight as too much }of a problem, but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go? }I want her to hold onto me :-) rather than the grab rail out back, and }I've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're }turning so she leans *with* me, but what else? Are there traditional 1) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension, adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves. 2) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are: a) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down. Not when you stop at a STOP sign, not when she thinks you're gonna crash, never. Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike. b) She is to hold onto your waist. She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. And (added bonus for you here), she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank. You decide how best to word this. c) Just stay perpendicular to the bike; straight up in the seat. Don't lean your body into curves, just go with the bike and stay perpendicular. Don't look over your shoulder.* 3) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. That means don't pop the clutch, and try to corner and stop smoother than usual. Be aware that if you jump on the brake, you're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind, so be prepared for that. 4) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go. No anti-women stuff here; I have a tiny bladder myself. 5) Remind her to look around while you're riding. Point to things of interest. It makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet), and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at. * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended "look over the rider's shoulder in curves" bit, and it just didn't work. The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the Maxim because, unlike the Ninja, the upright riding position really restricts the pillion's view of the road ahead). Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to the bike, and I could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves, and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.	8

Black ones look better. None are truely indiginous to America, although some of the finest are produced here. Gear is expensive, and you never seem have enough of it. Volvos hit them.

Loud ones are annoying, and too much chrome looks dumb. Yep, sounds familiar!	8

Another tip is to make sure you keep well to one side of the lane. This gives you a quicker escape route.	8

My reason for saying that was 'cause _I_, if _I_ were a cop wouldn't go out of my way to tell people how to break the law. Would you? The part about honesty was a joke, sorta.

I'm just starting out with motorcycles, I've read up on the subject a bit, talked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the same. But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get varied answers. I'm 6'3", about 230#, large/athletic build... I suppose that would help to determine the size bike i'd want. I want something that's going to be fast and powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it. I also want something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out. Any ideas?!

Car accessory shops here sell stuff called T-Cut, which is a very fine cutting paste for paint, and this will remove the dull finish and minor acratches. It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that you probably don't realise is there, and give your paintwork its original lustre and shine. It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint, though, so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. Afterwards apply wax polish, and all will be well again. BTW - don't confuse T-cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in valves...the principle's the same but the coarseness is vastly different...	8

: Oh bull pucky, Ed. They use dogs because a) Many people are : scared shitless of them and b) because of the nose and the : vision and hearing. Without their cop partner in attendance, : the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with : a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force. One of the things that police dogs are used for is to "take the bullet" instead of the human police officer. As Charles said, many people are scared of dogs and will panic when one goes on attack. They will then turn their weapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to take control. : Your advice is correct, but a dog is still no match for a trained : human in a fight. A single person vs. a single dog in a face-to-face confrontation should really be no contest. The dog is no match for a human willing to fight. Multiple dogs is a different story . . .	8

I had the same inconvenience when I bought my EX-500; only I could at least go 50 mph during the initial break-in. Despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days, I would follow the instructions, and just keep to city street riding for the first 500 miles. Heck, those miles go by fast, and it's worth it to know you haven't possibly screwed up your engine. At the same time, this has all the makings of a 6-week-long thread debating the whole break-in topic.	8

Did they ever put in any gas stations on US 12? I rode through there in 1987, skipped a fillup at Bryce Canyon and rode 100+ miles before seeing a gas station at Torrey. Awesome road, I recall riding up a narrow ridge above 9,000? 10,000? feet. -Bruce	8

Yep! I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . The wheelie was the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an intersection (damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers). However, I have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of pre-clutch dump rev action.	8

Yesterday, a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer. It has been a while since he last rode (>10 years), and I myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer. What follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of "SQUILDLY" behavior by other customers and/or sales personel: BACKGROUND: I ride with a group of friends, who mainly are into "cruiser" type bikes. My friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones. He wanted to see what the new ones were going for, so we happened upon a dealer that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha. The place was fairly busy, so we browsed a bit. We happened upon a few Intruders, most of which had SOLD signs on. My friend had been bitten. Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat, I moseid on outside. The next thing I know, I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in. I could stereo-type the type of riders (backward ball hat, oakley, IQ <40), but I won't. Well they went inside, I didn't think much of it. I figured to each his own. I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back, when I noticed the "hormone gang" talking to other salesdroids/managers. Lot's of laughter, jokes etc. No big deal. Here is the part that concerned me. The "HG" and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out, where said "HG" members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. At this point, one decided to see how much rubber a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive. SQUIDS, I thought to myself. BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager not only condoned this behavior, but encourged it, to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike, seemed rather hormonal about this display, and urged her "pilot" to quickly catch up. The others followed, making sure there Kerkers could be heard as well as felt. I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. I felt the eyes of those in cages, witnessing this display, then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels. Needless to say, my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left. I will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully, to clear my anger. I only hope that the cop who is following me home, has an open mind and doesn't associate me with them.	8

I know there's already a bmw mailing list, but since it's an R bike only list (and limited to the R80* R100* bikes as well I believe) I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is. please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list! there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it be about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech articles. to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address: bmw@rider.cactus.org with the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having the word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief. ** your From: line must have a valid return address ** ** the list sw will use the address in your From: line ** if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained in your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually. the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending on your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-). keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors parentage. to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address with the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief. the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA isn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make a decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount of time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it. if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number of addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up with a better MTA. good luck...	8

[...] So, in short, the 3/8" cables seems to be pretty useless, I would guess. The larger cable seems to be a much better unit. I've got the larger cable - about 5/8" inch in diameter (actually, I think its larger), about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil, with the tubular key lock like the U-locks. It has worked fine for me for two years now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure. It doesn't have the weaknesses that the U-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick supposedly, is much easier to store in my tankbag than a U-lock, and more versatile. I got mine from one of the mail-order houses (Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse, I beleive), for $42. In combination with an ignition disable, and a couple of other deterrents, all I *usually* worry about is vandalism.

Orating with wild abandon, prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu (Henry Prange) offers: %The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem %in the summer. Vibration? BMW's don't vibrate. Everyone knows that. I'd agree with Henry. The grips are really nice to have in winter, and aren't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer. My only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'. This has been complained about by every reviewer, official and unofficial, that's ever talked about these grips. The 'high' setting is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things just get a bit nippy, but since 'low' doesn't produce a noticable effect, I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature about right. This generally isn't a problem when wearing thicker winter gloves. When I asked the dealer if they could fix it, I received a consoling pat on the back, and their sincere apologies for the poor design (actually, I was told they worked just like they were suppose to). Vibration? What's that? I ride a BMW twin. You can barely tell if the engine is fired up or not most of the time, smoother than silk sheets.	8

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on his megabuck/micromass bike. He said he once repelled a dog attack by picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the head with the rear wheel. The dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he fled quite rapidly. Then again, he could jump garbage cans without a ramp, so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle. That's almost unfair, I've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)	8

Quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain most of their charge if drained and dried well, but I'd throw out the electrolyte and buy some more when you need it. And before anyone says I'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly OK even after several years' storage at the shop.	8
good point. the "list" actually started out as an extension of my GS v. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name. since inception, however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation has not always been "geared" to gs/pd/st-specific topics. when i raised the "to expand or not to expand/that is the question" question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings. the list has always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing "from:" line and there has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is appropriate. almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it. at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as possible. the list is fairly technical, with "how do i do this?", "what kind of that should i get?" kinds of questions. there has yet to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or "any bmw mfg'd after 1962 is a piece of shit" bashing. such posts are, by consent of the governed, proscribed. if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the net.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress. so, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded? -- -- bob pasker -- rbp@netcom.com	8

Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less. Also, in most instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more performance. I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on. The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 2-3K rpm. After talking to Kaz Yoshima, the developer and manufacturer of the slip on, he thinks I might need larger pilot, idle, jets. Was not suppose to but maybe where I live makes a difference. Altitude, barometric pressure... Anyway, besides that minor glitch, I like the slip on performance and the sound, which is louder than stock, but not loud enough to annoy folks. The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle. Just remember, every bike is a tuned system. When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer, you may have to change other areas to compensate. Like a complete change of the exhaust system, header and muffler, changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping profile. Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike. Check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on. Also, as a last data point, in Sport Rider's first issue, did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2. They also included, as a side bar, the Ontario slip on, the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel, 85 verses 91. Buyer beware, of outrageous claimed increases in horse power! It may have been true in the past, but not today!	8
The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike. And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear. So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers. I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line. (Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country) If I can't split (perhaps there isn't room) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped. I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will! Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop, I haven't had to find out yet. Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not! So in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your mirrors until it's all clear.	8
BUTT, BUTT, THEN YU W0NT BE ABLE T0 $EE THE CAR$ $NEAK!G UP BEHIND YU AND P0P A WHHHEEEEELLLLEEEEE T0 D!TCHUM AND THE CHICK$ DIG IT! Seriously, though, putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam liner that is expected to cushion your noggin. And once crushed, that foam never pops back. A variation of mirror hanging thing is what I do; with the bike on the sidestand (hey, the centerstand is for maintenance) I turn the wheel to the stop (left) and can hang the helmet by the chin-bar on the right grip. There is no crushable foam in the chin-bar, and it is pretty secure on there (as long as the forks are locked). If I have to leave the helmet with the parked bike (and the bags aren't on/full), that is about the most stable place.	8

Has anyone any experience with the (new?) Yamaha Cyclelok ? It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock, but unlike a U lock, it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large rectangle (longer length than any U lock I have seen, plus it folds down to real small), so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example. I was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack ? tony	8
This is maybe not a Pet Peeve, but definitely a Playmate Peeve: Does this make anyone's Skeptic Alarm (tm) go off? No offense, Bill, I don't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you know about this? Have you actually every used your secret method to break all the different kinds of bike locks? Or are you taking someone's word for it? The fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in rec.motorcycles. So please tell us what you are talking about. We can't even protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out with it. See, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the cordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones. The most plausable method (I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put a rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a truck. This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything. Since that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on to the next bike. (Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours! :-) What tactic are you referring to? If we don't know what you are talking about, we can't very well guard against it, can we? For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C insurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people about. (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious, they'll set off the alarm.) That's for a nice bike. For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would WANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make a profit on the deal. :-) Seriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week, and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking, but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light. I usually rig the cable locks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off. And I have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there. The only thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm). Oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off. That's the best that I can think of. Most of the locks I see people put on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound. I like ABUS, since I have personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot.	8

Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won their second straight 5-0. Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some recently rare power with their bats. Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed. Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine. In a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him--I should say so: all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls. Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts. Bobby Kelly followed with a single and Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right. The big guys (Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a Tomlin wild pitch. In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0. Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple. Milligan would later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead after 4. The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the left field line, chasing Tomlin. Barry later would score the final run on Tom Prince's two-base passed ball. The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second being of the "bunt" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith "K'd" to end any Pittsburgh hope. Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though: relievers Blas Minor, Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work. Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played bruised his right thumb. He was taken to the hospital for "precautionary X-rays". Let's hope he's OK.

Babe Ruth's lifetime pitching stats (selected): 94-46, .671. 2.28 ERA. 163 G, 107 CG, 17 SHO, 10.6 RAT. Best year: 1916, Bos: 23-12, 1.75 ERA (led league) or 1917, Bos: 24-13, 2.01 ERA	9
2 simple reasons: (1) Batting Williams ahead of Bonds will create a Left(Clark), Right(Williams), Left(Bonds) situation in the middle of the batting order. This makes it tougher for opposing manager to change pitchers. (2) Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get more good pitches to hit. This is important since he struggles so much with breaking balls. Opposing pitchers don't want to walk Williams to get to Bonds.	9

This is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division. But the Giants are going to need every break they can get, if they want too hold that lead. I don't think they can afford to be lackadaisical, and say "well it has worked pretty well so far, and while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is worth the risk". The two tend to go hand in hand...	9
Anyone have any idea how to get Japanese League stats regularly in the US? - matt wall@cc.swarthmore.edu Matt Wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * Hey, I gotta job here, OK?	9
I don't really mind the length of games either. If they want to speed the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too. However, what I object to is the assertion by baseball people (Whitey Herzog, Buck Rodgers are who I've heard say this) that games are too long because hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to be expanded.	9
I've seen it as "Colmn" also. Blame the Associated Press. After the official scorer balances the official score card, they copy it and give it to several diffent people. One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up (using a template on a laptop) and transmit it to the AP offices in New York (Rockefeller Center) via the telephone. The box scores are not checked and just rebroadcasted over AP's news delivery services. If there are corrections, those are issued later. It is the person sitting in front of a laptop at Shea (or whereever) whose fault that is. [NOTE: The AP puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in most newspapers being the first one] Last week they were in Denver. Maybe the AP person in Denver did this (remember, they just started with MLB out there). Check tomorrow's paper (4/21) and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the same thing.	9

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-: Invariably, all the arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the same thing: the games are too long and too boring. Baseball is trying to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal. If you look at it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football games. The difference is that there is "more action" in that duration in football games. Perhaps if there were "more action" in baseball games, you would get more of those fans to tune in. Anyway, coming up with a solution to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.

There is a fine line between "getting players' input" and "knuckling under to players' demands." A manager, much like a military officer, needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during a game. After the game, it's no big deal, but when there is no time to do more than react, players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart (see: Boston Red Sox, ff. :) ) Strawberry's demeanor as represented by the media, often sounds like demands. I suspect that a comment like "I enjoy hitting fourth; I'm used to it" would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry. Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying, "I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role." (Paraphrased by my memory and bias.) That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like, "How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order?" A more media-sensitive player might answer "The manager knows what he is doing. If he thinks that batting me third will help the team, then I am all for it." We'd ignore that answer as brown stuff, so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl's response as petulant. Personally, I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the #2-5 players in the order are batted, except for personal stats. If I were Darryl, I'd probably answer that question, "The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get paid for RBIs. I think it is best for me to bat fourth, but I am willing to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team." or something like that. It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was hitting third--and make him sound like a "team" player. Since Strawberry will not likely go through arbitration, but use the free agent market for his next contract, maybe that argument is useless, but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free.	9
I heard he had a strained abdominal muscle or something like that.	9
There is a great book out called "They Also Served" which is about the ballplayers during WWII. There is some info on Berg in there. It also has info on Pete Gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era. Because of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the draft for medical reasons. There are some very interesting stories in the book. It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an interest in baseball. Rob Koffler	9

Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Kevin Bass would not have made." OK, I realize that's unfair. Kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 49.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article. The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases -- Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate. DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Did anyone happen to see Peter Gammons on ESPN last night? He addressed this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly. According to Gammons, advanced scouts are reporting that Morris' fastball and slider still have the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability to keep the ball hidden during his release. Guzman and Stottlemyre have gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a little work with the pitching coach. Gammons looks to see Morris back in top form within the month. I, on the other hand, still have my doubts. Morris' ERA last year was rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games. His showing in the Series was not surprising. Although I'm not convinced that he's washed up, I have my doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the Twins in '91.	9
I laugh at you now, and I will laugh at you again, equally publicly, when the Jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent. I think Bill James put it best (about Sparky Anderson, _Abstract_ 1983): "There are a million guys in this country with great attitudes, but there are only about five hundred who can play a major league brand of baseball; which are you going to take?"	9
The garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday game. It started on Thursday or Friday (I can't recall which games I *didn't* watch on TBS). Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole time, it seemed. The announcers talked about the change in the seating in the bleachers, and how that made it easier for the events that transpired. I actually thought at the start of the Sunday slugfest that since it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different, more refined. Surprise?	9
I was at that game, behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the radar gun. The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didn't have his best fastball, topping out at 88-90 (in contrast to Frank Tanana, who went as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil Plantier *five* times on the night). Inky's shot would have gone further than any I've ever seen if it hadn't crashed *into* the lights (not the lightstand) as you say over 100 feet high, Roy Hobbs-like, and bounced back onto the field. That had to have been a 525-footer if unobstructed, edging out Bo Jackson's drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best I've seen personally (I was sitting under that one). --- Glenn Waugaman Digital Equipment Corporation Littleton, MA g_waugaman@nac.enet.dec.com	9
Close, but there's a number 3 also: 3. have entered the game with no more than a 3 run lead and pitched at least one inning. If a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won, does not get the win, and satisfies at least one of the three requirements, he gets a save. -Rusty --	9
Wait a minute. If I read the rules right. A stike is ANY portion of the ball over ANY portion of the plate. Given that the ball is ~ 2.9 "" in diameter. This sez that the zone width is ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9) or 22.8 "" . While this is still less than the 23 " number given. I can forgive any UMP for misjudging .2" on an object moving at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line. I think the Umpires Union has a great grasp of the rules!!!	9

It is ironic that in any post that criticizes langauge ability, the critic invariably makes a mistake himself ("english" is generally written "English".) Oddly, I do not see that I have contested any of that. Perhaps you, with assuredly greater "english" ability can explain, in tiny words that I might grasp their meaning, precisely WHERE I infer that you have said any of those things? No Mr Fisher, you should place the burden of proof on the one who makes the allegation in the first place. You do not. Perhaps you might explain why that is? As for the email route, Mr Fisher, you might have tried that yourself.	9
The injury is to his fielding hand, which is good. Unfortunately, he may have some ligament damage and may require surgery, which would lay him up for a while. Apparently just a strain of some sort. He hasn't been put on the DL, so it's probably just day-to-day.	9
I really think that this is the key point. When I saw the incident on Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate Gant went. Then he casually leaned against his bat. I don't blame the umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch. The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the field. What were they going to do, attack the umpire? The only people who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players. I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for having no control over his team.	9
Can anyone out there tell me Babe Ruth's complete pitching stats? I know he was 5-0 as a pitcher for the Yankees, but what were his numbers when he was with the Red Sox? Thanks in advance!	9
I watched the final inning of Bosio's no-hitter with several people at work. After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he wouldn't have had time to throw Riles out. Yet, the throw beat Riles by about two steps. I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? And if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an error or a hit? (Judging from Bosio's grimace when the ball bounced past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play. -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |	9
to take this to its, er, "logical" conclusion, it is impossible to ascertain whether or not i am a better hitter than roberto alomar, or a better pitcher than juan guzman, or a better center fielder than devon white. after all, if i were on the blue jays, can you really prove that they wouldn't have won the world series in both 1991 AND 1992? while i thank you, mister maynard, for your faith in my atheletic prowess, i can assure you that your faith is misplaced.	9
Are you kidding? I'm stuck with the Toronto SkyDome, where their idea of a 7th inning stretch is that "Blue Jays" song where everyone gets to yell: "Okay, okay, Blue Jays, Blue Jays, Let's Play Ball!" Wow.. what genius did it take to compose that one, to outshine the old classic. And there are women on the field to "lead the crowd".	9
It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average. Yes, the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP. That's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 (zip, nil, nada) walks. The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he's has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for drawing walks). If he hit .400 for, say, even 250 AB's I'd be convinced that there was a real change in his ability. If he did it with an OBP<AVG, I'd not only be amazed but I'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game. But what do 45 AB's prove? Look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season: Player AVG AB Blauser .367 49 Grace .391 48 Milligan .400 35 Conine .375 40 Lansing .400 50 Slaught .406 32 Are any of these guys really that good? Well, in a word, no. How significant is Galarraga's average? At the 45 AB level, a hit is worth about .020. If he'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play, he'd be in the .380 range. If he goes 0-for-4 in his next game he's all the way down to .388. In one game. Come back in June. Let's talk then. It's history, Greg. Andres' history is that he doesn't walk much because he swings at bad pitches, so his average isn't very good. 45 AB's doesn't mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand, especially when there's ample evidence (0 BB in 1992) that his basic hitting approach hasn't changed. Yeah, he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks, but don't bet the rent money on it. Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com	9
Not totally true. For the past year or two, the AP has been getting box scores from STATS, Inc. The AP representative in the press box is actually a STATS reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking. And anybody can do it.) The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago, some quick error checking is done, and then STATS sends it to the AP. I'm not sure where the appreveiations come in hear. I don't think it is at STATS's. It may just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day. While I'm mentioning STATS reporters, they are always looking for new people. Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh, you're road to getting into the press box may be real short. For more info, call STATS (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network. It's a fun way to get paid for watching baseball games. End of public service announcement.	9
I don't understand this at all. Matt Williams has demonstrated throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit. He won't take walks. He'd rather swing. If I'm the opposing pitcher, why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well, when I know that Williams will swing (and miss, or at least not hit very well) at a low and away curve?	9
Not bad. We had a similar situation. Slowpitch softball, bases loaded, weakest hitter at the plate. He hits a line drive over the third baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field. But the umpire called fair ball! I was coaching third, yelling at evrybody to move up a base. The ump's position: "it was still fair when it passed third base". Why the other team didn't immediately protest I'll never know; we certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage to advance one base safely. There was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner from second base) leg, fielded by the SS, steps on second to force the runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.	9
Dummy Hoy, a late 19th-Century baseball player, was deaf. In order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or strike, the umpires developed hand signals. This also helped to relieve the stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout "STRIKE!!!" or "BALL!!!!!" 350 times a game... Heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book John Thorn has ever authored, "A Century of Baseball Lore" :-)	9
How is that possible? He was on the Albuquerque Leftturns last year. How could you possibly know what team he would be on if Manny Lee was on his team last year. After all, Manny Lee wasn't on his team last year, so it's complete, unfounded speculation to state that if he was on the same team as Manny Lee last year, it would have been the team of the Toronto Blue Jays. Since he and Lee weren't on the same team, you cannot possibly objectively state what team they would have been on if they had both been on the same team.	9

Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop *wasting* so much time during games. The Gant incident is a perfect example. When a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off (or show up the umpire, which is clearly what Gant was doing). I feel like writing a fan letter to Hirschbeck.

Here's a few two-sport star trivia questions. I'll admit they're not too difficult, but a bit challenging nevertheless. Mail me your answers please; or post them. 1. Which pitcher played for the Harlem Globetrotters? 2. Which major leaguer briefly tried professional golf in 1978? 3. Which does Dieon Sanders have more of (professionally): career touchdowns or triples? 4. Has there been any player of both pro hockey and baseball? If so, name him and the years he played each. If you have any other two-sport star tidbits, feel free to include them.	9
Some time back in this newsgroup, I seem to recall a thread about predicting the runs a given lineup of 9 batters could be expected to score given the appropriate statistical alphabet soup for these hitters (OBP, SLG, AVG, bat length, hat size, day-of-the-week, weather conditions, etc.). :-) Anyway, was I dreaming or is there some such animal? My apologies if this has been covered recently, I probably get to read 10% of the articles posted here. No time.

} Last night, Boston Red Sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating Seattle } 5-2. Roger Clemson pitch not so dominate. He walked at least 6 man in } first 6 inns. But Valetin and Greenwell hit homeruns and Red Sox prevail. Clemens struggled with his control, but was also the "beneficiary" of some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were early in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say it?) some pretty good defense by the Sox, including Rivera playing at second, not his normal position. actually, Clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the Sox almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on Mo's error catching a throw-over. } I think that game is must win for Red Sox in Seattle, considering Darwin will } faced Seattle ace Randy Johnson tonight. must win? in April? they've already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this point of the season... i hope people aren't getting too caught up in this streak; it's been fun, but teams have 11-3 streaks all the time, and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get so much attention.	9
It took three days to get to us, but I'll try anyway as I naturally haven't seen the answer. SAFE. The correct call is "Infield Fly, (batter out) if fair". Runners may advance at own risk. (Gotta tag up if caught, etc.) It is not a force, and the pop was not caught, so regardless of whether the SS tags 3B or 2B (it wasn't clear, above), he hasn't got the runner out. OUT. See rule 6.05(L) APPROVED RULING. (Below). In this case, the umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule doesn't apply. (Sounds like a bad call here, but that's not the point). The batter is not out, so a force situation is created. Therefore, the runner is out. ( UNLESS, by rule 6.05(L) the ball is dead AND the batter is safe, then I guess the runners would advance unmolested. I can't really tell from 6.05(L) that the ball is dead in this situation.) Pertinent rules: 2.00 Definition of Infield Fly: "When an Infield fly is called, runners may advance at their own risk. If on an infield fly rule, the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball, the ball remains in play despite the provisions of Rule 6.05(L). The Infield Fly rule takes precedence." 6.05(L) A batter is out when: an infielder intentionally drops a fair fly ball or line drive, with first, first and second, first and thrid, or first,second and third base occupied before two are out. The ball is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base or bases. APPROVED RULING: In this situation, the batter is not out if the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground, except when the infield fly rule applies.	9
Rust Staub is NOT Jewish. In fact, I think his father was a minister.	9
As I recall from Kieth Hernandez' 'auto'biography, Rusty is a devout Roman Catholic. Kieth and Rusty would carpool to Shea everyday but Sunday, when Rusty would go to mass. SC	9
I guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in fact all year) have been pretty much consistently CORRECT. Remember: the rule says it's a strike if ANY PART of the ball passes through the strike zone. I would certainly agree that high strikes are not called (who could argue this point?) but all in all I think in and out is called pretty well.	9
Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running into the outfield wall. This being the reason he was available to pinch- anything. His ribs were the problem so he could run but not hit. Torre is no white rat but give him credit for what he is , a pretty darn good manager. with the exception of the Felix fiasco, but i'm not sure who's brainchild that was. -BIL	9
a) Dominican b) not all that light-hitting. .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73 when he did most of his playing. c) Professional pinch-hitter after that. Yes, that also gives you Jerry Hairston. Beginning 10th year now. Good one. Not the same thing. LOTS of people are bad OFs. Not all that light either. .750 OPS. Not 10 year. 10-year this year. Not 10-year. Not 10-year. Yup. OK. 10-year this year. *Six*-year this year. Brock, Coleman, and Wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also Lonnie Smith); that seems to be a special class. CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well. And Brock wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he spoiled his ifetime .300 BA. And again, I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time. But if you look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to be a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon players and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were white. Light hitting? 199 HR, .793 lifetime OPS mainly with *HOUSTON*? Also Latin, btw. Come back in 1999 and we'll party^H^H^H^H^H talk.	9
I wholeheartedly endorse it. I have no problem with the Haven't been to many A's games, have you? Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played. However, I don't like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going on in that game. I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason (Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage). I want to see the game, not people standing around. I don't really enjoy watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television, because they're busy showing you replays). I don't like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game (the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year, and they're going to a 35 second clock). There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person. For me, going to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not willing to make that often: the length of their games is costing the A's revenue from me.	9

Newsgroups: rec.sport.baseball Harry talks about this "incident" in his autobiography "Holy Cow." Unfortunately, I can not clarify on this since (1) I read the book a couple of years ago and (2) I do not have my book with me. Anyway, It is a pretty interesting book if you are a Harry or Cubs fan.	9

So what is your definition of "interfering with the fielder taking the throw"? The rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification, so it's possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner, then again we have interference. You know, it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly--if the catcher (or the pitcher, say Rob Dibble, for example) throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline, the fielder takes the chance of being ejected. Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or (your scenario) above him. You should note that in our American Legion League, (which uses MLB rules) we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference per rule 7.09.	9

o any of you experts want to analyze Ron Gant? Is his early season slump because he is still swinging his bat the way he was last year (trying to hit to all fields, etc.) or has he changed his swing back to the "old" Gant and is just in a small early season slump. Is his spot int he lineup even secure, especially the way he has been hitting? -- msilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu GO CUBS!!!	9
The problem with your nihilistic approach, Roger, is that it takes all the sense out of the game. By your line of reasoning, if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded, there's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise, so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. After all, any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but didn't. Roger, do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence? Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division. If they don't make the post-season, they don't win the Series. Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting? If so, you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division, and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games. In your viewpoint as expressed, winning games happens for reasons that cannot be analyzed. While many of us are thinking things like "Base- runners are good, outs are bad, and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded", you are thinking things like "It's a team game, so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today". The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players. Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field. After all, perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it. Therefore, I could be an extremely valuable player. Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays' victory? Probably, but how do you know? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga, perhaps the Jays would have won, perhaps they would have lost, perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto). Was Babe Ruth a good player? He played on some WS-winning teams, but did he have anything to do with their success? It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player, and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder weren't. It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof. Now, we have observed things about baseball over the years, both empirically and by looking at the rulebook. It is necessary to score more runs than one's opponent to win the game, so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one's opponent from scoring. Runs are scored while a team is batting, and an inning ends after the third out, so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels, and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year. We do use these statistics to predict winners, and so do you. To make some flat predictions: Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than Gene Larkin this year. The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings. The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals, but will also give up more. I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false, and, I suspect, so would you. As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year, given 3-4 guesses per division, and this is certainly better than random chance (and almost statistically significant). If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series, you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods, however fuzzy. So how about "real life"? Person A robs a service station with two people in it, using a .38 automatic pistol, gets $42, and is convicted and sentenced for three years. Person B, with a similar criminal record, robs a service station with two people in it, using a .38 revolver, gets $42, and is convicted. Since they used two different types of handgun, are comparisons totally meaningless? Say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always testing this - they don't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time). You have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before, so all previous evidence is meaningless? Or would you be surprised if it flew out the window instead of hitting the desk?	9
why?	9
Hi- Does anybody know the # for ticket info for Fenway? Thanks	9
[detailed explanation deleted..] Indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. To rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance. Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win. Well, that's certainly true in Lotto. But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball. When you start down the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path. I repeat. I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance. I do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance. And I think Chris Sabo is such a player. -- The Beastmaster	9
Minor point: Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant. The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium (from the Polo Grounds) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management (the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972). The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea. When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise, the New York Titans, approached the City about using the new stadium. The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium (where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s). Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World's Fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World's Fair (like they were doing with the Mets). So the deal was worked out. I'm under the impression that when Murph says it, he means it! As a regular goer to Shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and renovated the place. Remember, this is its 30th Year!	9
How do you know they can be shortened by half-an-hour? Has anybody done a study to determine how much time is actually "wasted" -- say, in these A's games?	9
You haven't been facing major league pitching. Maybe more... you have to be good at the plate, and most STATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled "Can you hit sacrifice flies on purpose?" A summary of the findings: Over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful. They looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill. Essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without a runner on third. STATS concludes "So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING cage."	9
Yes, but (a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages and (b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far as anyone can tell I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable to or better than Winfield. In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you could make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others. This is not a knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has been more uniformly excellent. Hall of Fame? Absolutely. Top-10 peak? I'm not so sure. Top 10 total career value? Yes, almost certainly.	9
Sorry, Sherri, but I can't agree with this particular incident. While I'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving, there was a difference here. 1) Since time immemorial, batters have complained about calls. So have pitchers and catchers. Usually, nothing happens. Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints, Hirschbeck was acting against expectations. 2) It's not as if Gant was "in Hirschbeck's face". Gant said something about the call, stepped out of the box, and turned away from Hirschbeck. As a hitter (alibet of little consequence, but with a decent eye), whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call, I'd want a moment or two out of the box, if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch. And if I was really angry at the ump, I'd rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed, especially at a key moment in the game. When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box. IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game. Gant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle. And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play. Gant resisted, as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and Hirschbeck called for the pitch. At that point, Cox came out on the field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the dugout. Cox was tossed "protecting his player". I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game. It's a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game, Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play God on the field. Not good qualities for an umpire. I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future, in order to improve my sample size. IMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire.	9

You want to speed up ballgames? 1. Enforce the two minutes between innings. As it is, many fields are allowing THREE minutes between them. Fifteen seconds before TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon the return to the game. Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or a ball is called. 2. Don't grant time to batters just because they want it. They may get pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike. 3. Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current rule is too lenient), and then enforce it. Fifteen seconds is more than enough time. If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball, and restart the clock. Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours in the AL. That's just too damn long. I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour games, much less WATCH a game for that long. My butt falls asleep, and if I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catching colorized versions of Mr. Ed, Leave it to Beaver, and "Those Wacky Nieporents" on Nick at Nite.	9

I don't buy this at all. I think things are colored to a very large degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are. Try this exercise: XXX is pitching today. His team scores 4 in the first inning, and 3 in the fourth. XXX gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th. In the fifth, he gives up 3 runs. In the 6th, he gives up 2 more. The score is now 7-5, with XXX's team still on top. I contend that if XXX were Jack Morris, the assessment would be "he is a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win." If XXX were Mike Trmbley, the assessment would be "he is an inexperienced rookie who doesn't know how to pitch. Needs more seasoning. Send him to AAA. Or to the spice rack."	9
The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age. Even if Morris were performing as well as Clemens right now, and were likely to this season, nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because Clemens has more of his career left.	9

writes... Oh, probably. Ms. Nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for 1983 and 1992. (A very nice piece of information, Ms. Nichols. Who knows? She may be listening, and not have me in her kill file after all.) Those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game, and the games taking 15 minutes *longer*. Something is being done now that wasn't done ten years ago, which is extending the games by 15 minutes. Ms. Nichols thinks it's more pitches. Given the increasing specialization of pitchers, it wouldn't surprise me. If it's not simply more pitches, though, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back. Then I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in, and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules, which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones). The problem is, who decides whether that time is "wasted?" You don't seem to think it is at all. Right now, I think it is, although I have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the difference in mounds between the field and pen) -- but who knows? If the rules get changed, maybe something I didn't foresee will happen to change my mind. But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing, or else nothing will be changed. RG	9
the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a large enough portion of the population, and have suggested various "remedies", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that "smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation" is an accurate description of what is, essentially, a laid-back game. forget those lame ideas. here is my new and exciting two-point plan to generate interest in baseball among the masses. point one: sex. point two: violence. let's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in america. here's how we can implement them in the game: sex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders. dancing on top of the dugouts. bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh inning stretch. running up and down the stands. (the south bend white sox actually do this). violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a "bench-clearing brawl". EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand, stand, stand. look, look, look. ho, hum. then, the bullpens come running in. when they reach the "fight", they just stand there, too. anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch should be suspended and fined. further, the bullpens should fight it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running to the infield. football: sex, violence. basketball: sex, violence. hockey: violence. baseball: "da pastime of da nayshun!" - yawn.	9
Quite honestly, this one is ridiculous. Consider the following scenario: Runner on third. As the pitcher starts to throw home, the runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for the suicide squeeze. The pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home, but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down. It is the balk rule that prevents this from happening. Believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an OBA (Ontario Baseball association) game in Milton, Ontario. I was the batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it. In the 12 years that I played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring I ever saw.	9
Come back ten years from now and look at the careers of Juan Gonzalez vs. Mark McGuire, and then tell us how bogus the Juanderful one's 1992 HR title was. I'd say that by 2003, Juan will be preparing his HOF acceptance speech while the voters will be saying "Mark McWho?"	9

I believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died. Uh, he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car, and smashing it into a tree, as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. And the speeding reported was over 100 mph; reckless driving. Actually, I hadn't heard about this; thanks. I don't know what you were reading or watching, but I sure saw a LOT about that, and about Dykstra's poker games. Most of the writing was along the lines of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he'd hurt the team by wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. ESPN raised questions about his judgement, etc. The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary action wouldn't be taken against Dykstra, and one article pointed out that if Lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that wouldn't endanger other people's lives. Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it was, etc. Mike	9
I believe Acker got a ring from his wife when they were married I don't know why you guys keep bickering about Morris. The stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened to win 21 games. I saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good games. But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings) and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him. Another major factor in his 21 wins, is that Cito 'I dont realize i have a bullpen' Gaston would leave Morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

Cool. And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly name-calling of others. :) One of the basic things you need to OK. Actually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem. It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball in regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of bell curve. (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting vs. non-clutch; the Y-axis being the number of players.) Certainly there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell. My *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players (as opposed to all baseball players). As a counterexample to You won't hear those kind of accusations from me. It is interesting that you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also looked at. He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA), hitting in 1989 - 92 .217, .273, .250, .272 Admittedly, he has been traded between leagues as well as clubs. His clutch hitting record is equally inconsistent. So, for my purposes in 1993 I would not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based on his prior performance. I don't know how I would have felt in 1988, but you may indeed be right. When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately below his non-clutch BA. Ditto for Joe Carter. This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having with others on this topic. Must any conclusion based on statistical history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before it has any validity? Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply statistical analysis to selected components of the data base? I completely accept that reasoning. Again, what if we were to find the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent basis? amen. -- The Beastmaster	9

How can anyone pick the worst Yankee pitcher. In the past 12 years there have been so many. Does the name Steve "You mean I should try and throw the ball to the catcher" Trout?	9
A-hem. Two words: Russell Davis. Playing in the cavern at Albany (AA) last year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), Davis went .285/.355/.483 with 22 homers. There aren't any small parks on the road in the Eastern League, either. He's 23(!) and his MLE was .258/.308/.416, 17 HR. I have no fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year I'd say that he's not Brooks Robinson, but neither is he Howard Johnson. Unless they think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need Boggs to do it, I think they're making the same sort of mistake with Davis that Boston made with Boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter. Hrm? They still have him on the roster (16 AB through the first two weeks). They've just never figured out what to do with him. I suspect that he hits enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. One rumor running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert Silvestri to be a catcher(!) because "his body type was wrong for a shortstop". You'd think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays Baltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better. Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com	9
Yep. And the Ks don't have to denote a slow game, either. Last night, Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down (14 Ks in 8 innings), yet the first 7 1/2 innings of the game were quite brisk. He also threw 119 pitches, leading me to believe it isn't just the number of pitches that determines the length of a game, but the behavior *between* pitches.	9
While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around, Gant wasn't ordered back in the box "sooner", he was ordered back immediately. As soon as he stepped out, Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box. Now, Gant doesn't take a lot of walks between pitches. The only reason he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call. I expect his concentration wasn't there yet, and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as possible. Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate, bad year at the plate, and the Braves long scoring drought. Now, it's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there. You know the umpire is going to do something (call for a strike, throw you out, etc.). Gant was wrong. But Hirschbeck was more wrong, in my biased view. Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder, what was the problem. Gant had a reason to want some time (disputed strike call). Gant hadn't been wasting time all game. The game had been cruising along, and was just over two hours old. The score was 1-0, with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position. Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck couldn't, and shouldn't, cut Gant a little slack? For no discernible constructive reason, Hirschbeck disrupted the game, caused a five minute delay, and materially hurt the batter in a key situation. Did he have a date to get to? And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game. -- Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic	9

Nah, let's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST obvious flamebait, like yourself. If someone posts something as controversial (not to mention idiotic) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup, someone should challenge the statement. There is a school of thought that suggests that silence = consent. Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life, it certainly SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion, which r.s.b. is. If you've been reading r.s.b. lately, you'll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings, alibet in an edited form. It's making me think a little more carefully about some of the things I post. In conclusion, if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that I don't read, fine. He's got the right to rant, rave, and drool all he wants to in the name of free speech. But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read, then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his drooling. Now, of course, you don't have to read any of this. And if you want to cut down on flames, then DON'T POST FLAMEBAIT! (You don't have to respond to flames, either. Saves cyberspace)	9
Hi there, I was wondering if anyone knew if John Wetteland was put on the DL again after his first 15-day period was up? I read in the USA Today Sports section that he is on for "surgery to repair broken toe", and was wondering if that was new. I thought he was just letting it heal. Another question, Is Derek Lilliquist the main closer for the Indians now that Olin is gone. I need to know cause I need to find a reliever to replace Wetteland and so far Lilliquist is doing ok. Any information on either of the players would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. Ryan Robin. ___________________________________________________________	9
But why McGwire, and not Carter? I can see some justification for Bonds or Thomas, because they tend to have higher batting averages, but the major difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesn't draw walks. Why aren't pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter?	9
Matt's problem is really more ability than attitude. It isn't that he's got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's (still) a total sucker for the curve ball. It looked for a while in 1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point. As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him, the net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As to whether the Giants' lineup is optimal: who knows? Batting Bonds, the team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2 hitters aren't exactly Messrs. OBA, so they aren't giving much up there. And although Clark isn't the overall offensive force that Bonds is, he seems better suited to the #3 spot. Assuming, of course, that he starts hitting one of these days...	9

Oh, yea, and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER. One over the minimum, two bases on ball in the first inning, one runner left, 95 pitches. I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat (as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite, I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me). But, I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching, it would have been a different story :-) Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest, best hitting team in Major League baseball .... Pretty impressive in any league. Man, if Johnson, Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year. Also, John Cummings (rookie) has had three solid outings with no support. If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year (relief is another story, though - grimace). Too cool. The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end. And again, I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game. The guy is truly a joy to listen to -- he deserves a pennant race ...	9

I wonder why you say that? I don't see why having a spouse and/or kids would have anything to do with it. It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour (in which case I'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends, as many people do, or else be prepared to leave the game early), but from what you say later on, you don't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game. As it happens, I have a husband but no kids, and my husband usually attends games with me. I can see it's a problem if you don't bring your wife to the ballgame, but that's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours. As far as bagging work the next day, I don't really understand why that's necessary, unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer (I note that this is the case for many guys). If you don't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening out, then don't have long evenings out during the week. Look: if I pay between $8.00 and $20.00 apiece for tickets, plus $10.00 for parking, plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston, plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark, then I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. I can't afford to go to a lot of games. Hence, going to a game is a big deal, like going to a play or an opera. Maybe you have more money than I do and can go to games all year long, so it's not such a big deal for you. But I'm not interested in having games "sped up", any more than I want to have _Die Walkure_ cut down to a convenient "weeknight version" of two hours. If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere with my family life or my work life, then I'd choose to go to a weekend game. IMPO.	9

Baltimore Baseblazers? Where the hell did you come up with that? The Orioles are not a base-stealing team except for Anderson. Besides we would never call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles. Why? The ballpark has all these orthologically (spelling error?) correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all over the place. I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole. It's not. The bird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded. They're called Baltimore Orioles. But the post is just a joke so why do I care what a non-O's fan thinks of us? But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from. San Diego Padres, now there's a name that needs to be changed. How is padre being used? As "Father" ie priest or "father" ie parents?	9
A HBP, but it reminds of my favorite (apochryphal ? sp ?) Don Drysdale story. When ordered to intentionally walk a batter who had hot-dogged on him in two previous at-bats, Drysdale reared back with the first pitch and drilled him right in the ribs. His manager came storming out of the dugout and yelled "What did you do that for ?" Drysdale growled back, "What are you complaining for ? I saved you three pitches !" Incidentally, if this is true, I'd love to know the other people involved. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ted Kury | "One man stands... and the wall, cracks... and the wall, SUNY at Buffalo | cracks... and the wall, cracks... and the wall comes Dept. of Economics | crumbling down." - Anthrax	9
And you know what? There is no such method inherent in real life either. So I would assume you would endorse the notion that we cannot state, with any level of objectivity, that Mother Theresa has accomplished more good in this world than Joseph Stalin. After all, life on earth is a team effort. Have you tried glasses? I find them quite useful. After all, there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds of evidence we present. It's too bad you feel it necessary to close your mind and eyes to knowledge; you live a poorer life as a result of that choice. Heck, I'd wager that you could predict a WS winner with greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon. And you know why? Because I have full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary, you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level. Have you tried calling a kettle black? In other words, in your world, you cannot objectively state that Jack Morris was more important to the Blue Jays than Al Leiter last year. In your world, that may indeed be true. Fortunately, in the world the rest of us occupy, it's not. I hope you never serve on a jury, Roger. I think the rest of the jury would have to kill you. "There's no way I can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty. You see, there are 2 billion other people on this planet. We have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't for all the other people on the planet. We have no way of knowing how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet, because living on this planet is a team effort. And no individual committs a crime totally isolated from his society; he is a part of that society. That being case, anything I have to say on his culpability would be absolute subjectivity, so I refuse to vote."	9
To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way they used to. I'm talking about making the strike zone start at the knees and go up to the top of the letters. Forget this "the strike zone is in the general area of the groin". A lot less 3-and-2 counts and a quicker game.	9

I need a little help from a Texas Rangers expert. I was at Yankee Stadium Sunday (12-2 Texas rout) with my kids. We wandered out to the outfield during Rangers batting practice and I caught a ball tossed into the stands (actually wrestled some guy a bit, I might add) by #62 on the Rangers. Who is he? Looked like a bullpen assistant type, youngish I think. He was not in the roster listed in the Yankee scorecard. Any ideas? Please e-mail as I haven't been reading r.s.b regularly. Thanks. - Bob	9
Be fair. He did walk 6 batters in 6.1 IP. He also allowed only three hits, none for extra bases. Only one run. A pretty good outing, all told. There is no such thing as a "must win" game this early in the season. And we can always *hope* that Darwin pitches well!	9
Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average stats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive performances, compared to league average. I've combined those with my position-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total run values for players last year. We can use these as a springboard for reconsideration of the MVP award. Major caveats: these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if San Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the infield, that will cause some inaccuracies. The offensive numbers are position-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and inflate others to be fair. Finally, we still don't know what to do about catchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions of Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts. Having said that, there are still some surprises. Let's look National League first. All numbers in total runs contributed over the season. Player Offense Defense Total Sandberg 44 32 76 Bonds 67 3 70 Walker 26 26 52 Justice 14 33 47 Daulton 44 ?? 44+? Larkin 36 4 40 Grace 13 27 40 As I see it, these are the legitimate MVP candidates from last season. If you deflate Sandberg's offense a wee bit for playing in Wrigley, you get essentially a dead heat. Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it wouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case. Darren Daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference, and I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible. A good case could be made for any of Sandberg, Bonds, or Daulton as top dude. My personal vote: Bonds, Sandberg, Daulton, Walker, Justice. In the American League: Player Offense Defense Total Ventura 22 34 56 Martinez 47 -1 46 B. Anderson 21 25 46 Thomas 47 -5 42 R. Henderson 25 16 41 Raines 17 23 40 Tettleton 33 ?? 33+? OK, let's see a show of hands: how many of you picked Robin Ventura as top player in the AL last year? I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time arguing against him at this point. Yes, I know these numbers are only approximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy. Also, those of you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds. Once again, there's a catcher in the ointment. If calling a game is as important as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away). TAke a guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that. My personal vote (excluding pitchers): Ventura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson. I'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of balanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher leverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with negative defense. For the record: Carlos Baerga 27 5 32 Roberto Alomar 35 -2 33 Forget it; it's a wash. Let me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding Don Mattingly's defense this past season. Don recovered brilliantly from his weak '90 and '91 to end up with Mattingly -1 17 16 runs which is clearly an above-average first baseman. However, it's still 18 runs behind Mark McGwire, 26 runs behind Frank Thomas, and 7 runs behind John Olerud. On the other hand, it's ahead of Rafael Palmeiro, Cecil Fielder, and every other AL first baseman not yet mentioned.	9
In Article: 106628 of rec.sport.baseball, <HEALEY@QUCDN.QueensU.CA> (Roger Healey) wrote >> Yes, the stance is new. Don Baylor was his batting coach at St. Louis last year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him. Maybe Andres has a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the ball. Or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - I dunno. But the change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago. His selectivity has not changed.	9
DJ was a popular player in San Diego, Derek Bell was not faring well in the clubhouse at Toronto, so no matter how bad he looks now I still think it was a steal for the Jays just from the perspective of team chemistry. No statistic can describe it (sorry statheads) and since there are so many new faces in the clubhouse I think the Jays are still trying to find it. (Insert the same comment into the Jack Morris v. Clemens WS Ring string) Yet at first I was sad to see Derek go, still anticipating all of the talent they raved about at the beginning of last season. I'm glad to see him faring well for the Padres though.	9
The original poster wanted to know how the Big Cat looked. I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal (Apr 17) that Rockies won 9-1. I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different. He stands more erect and very open, with his left foot pointing to 3rd base. I'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. If this is indeed a new stance for him, maybe he is not being fooled as easily? As for his patience, Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. If he was grooving pitches to Andres, you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did!). Does Andres generally start hot or cold? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away?	9

Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST. (It was 7:35 last year, but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back.) I go, and I'm into it until 11 PM minimum. Extra innings could put me well past midnight. Even without extra innings, if the score is beyond 2-1 I can't see my family that night at all. If the next day is a workday, I may have to bag that as well. Further, the later the game goes, the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie. All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.

Total Baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive and defensive contributions, gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of 9.0 for 1992. Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark: Cal Ripken for his 1984 season. Rounding out the top five offensive players in the NL last season: Sheffield, 5.9; Sandberg, 5.8; Van Slyke, 5.3; and Larkin, 4.7. The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were: E. Martinez, 4.8; Ventura, 4.8; Anderson, 4.5; R. Henderson, 4.4; and Thomas, 4.4 In short, Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by Mantle, Mays, Williams, etc. (If you disagree, don't flame me; flame the writers of Total Baseball.) Also, Martinez and Ventura are neck and neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one had the better year can be considered a toss-up. Thus, Total Baseball supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992. -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |	9
I need the box score from the April 15 game I believe the score was 5 to 4 if anyone can provide it for me I would appreciate it....	9
He dimmagio's. Henderson's stat's are probably closer to DiMaggio's than you think.	9
Stole 300 bases. (Ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't think so, they think he, like Omar Moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff man. Awesome defense.) He's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 HR. Hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs. Wasn't a full-time major-leaguer until 1988. Consistent .300 hitter. We'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year. Same goes for Herm. Doesn't count then. Redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases. Close to 800 OPS career against LHP. We'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify. Slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters' parks in the NL. He's going to be one of Colorado's better players this year. Plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox. Coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being weak offensively, though of course he was. Led NL in SB his first six years in the majors. We'll see if he's still around in 1997. Wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year stretch and led the league in triples five times. But we can count him if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's Otis Nixon deluxe with slightly worse defense. Okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome. He's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man. Halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there. Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as light-hitting. Neither was Curt Flood. Cesar Cedeno was *not* light- hitting. He'll have to steal a lot more bases.	9
^^^^^^ Sure they might. If an error is recorded on, for example, a ground ball, ie the batter would otherwise be out, it is officially a hitless at bat. If it's some other type of error (Greenwell lets a single go by), it doesn't effect the OBP. But, most errors are counted.	9
Tickets are very hard to get, even at the box office at Camden Yards. If you really want to see a game here (I go to school in Baltimore), price should not be an issue. Tickets go up to $15, but you should be willing to go as high as $20-25 if you really want to come.	9
Okay, I'm curious. Why? Are you expectin the Commissioner to fly in and stand on the pitchers mound to yell at the fans to sit down, or what?	9
In this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), Vizquel was quoted as saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still easily thrown out Riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the final play more memorable. Seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it work so he's entitled. -- Doug Dudgeon Dept. of Chemical Engineering, BF-10 dudgeon@opus.cheme.washington.edu University of Washington, Seattle	9

Good question! I kind of wondered about this myself. Just one thought I had on it - the Babe himself was IN "Pride of the Yankees", which made me think a) that version may be closer to the truth, and b) the Babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even though some of the scenes didn't make him look completely flattering.	9
To all the Braves doubters: Don't worry. The bats will come alive, and the Braves will come around. The pitching is solid, and as long the Braves don't have serious injuries to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well. Heck, with the five starters on the Braves rotation, they could even sustain an injury to one of the five (I hope this doesn't happen, though). The bats are there... Pendleton will certainly bat over .280, Justice is catching fire, Bream, Nixon, Sanders, Gant... well, there's too much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. Right now, the Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over .300! But I certainly wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting over .300?). The bullpen... well, it IS suspect. But when the bats come alive, the guys in the bullpen will be of less concern. So anyway, I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season. I'm not saying the Braves have automatically won the division, but I'm optim- istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at times right now). Go Braves!!!	9
Sorry, I still don't buy it. You're certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with the play. But the argument here is over what constitutes interference. You certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted a definition of interference at all. IMO this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print in the rulebook. Something like: APPROVED RULING: If in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be judeged guilty of interference. or APPROVED RULING: The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball. -- In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.	9

When I say "black," I mean US-born black people for the purposes of this discussion. Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947, and one team in the 50's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better with the local audience than blacks did. Don't know. But remember: this is the country that had special racial laws for one group and one group only: blacks. Our national history includes huge, long-term, global tensions regarding the black minority; the hispanic minority, while often discriminated against, has never been the object of national obsession. Absolutely. As I said before, I expect that this effect is disappearing. But it certainly did exist, and all out talk of TWG's and all that is not without some small reason. Well, there's the list. Go for it! I'll cull some more names as I go. I expect you're right, btw.	9
Well, no. Although I admit that's more exciting than a rat killer. -- Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic	9
That'll teach me not to qualify my statements... OK, something to shoot for. The Royals will score 531 runs or less this season (although they just decided to get McRae out of the leadoff spot :-( ) Of course, Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the Royals even manage to outscore another AL team. Sean	9
You are absolutely correct. Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of bandwagoners. Correct me if I am wrong, but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give away a ticket to see the Braves play.I would bet my next paycheck that 80% of the so-called Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. On the other hand, ask any Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given year and 80% of them probably could. Granted, the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park, but that does not mean they diserve the title "America's Team" The only reason they are considered America's team is because of Ted Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation. I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves GO REDS!	9
A few weeks ago I posted about the Phillies team personalities. Did anyone see the ESPN feature on the Phils on Monday Night. John Kruk had a great line. He was talking about people on the team always playing and not sitting out because of a minor injury. He said if they do they know we'll kick their ass. The time I saw in was in the afternoon and it was not bleeped. When I saw it at they bleeped "ass." Mitch Williams talked about the team being a bunch of throwaways from other teams, and that is why they are so close. Kruk said that they all get along this year. Last year, he said, they hated the pitchers. I assume he was joking, but he always keeps a straight face when he talks. Oh, What a team!!!!! Rob Koffler	9
I don't know. I think Phil Plantier has the ugliest stance. He looks like he's sitting on the toilet.	9
There's nothing wrong with a red neck. Why, some of us hicks even listen to cultured music and such, can you say the same? Aside from that, you shouldn't try to shit on this guy by insulting where YOU think he comes from. Where I'm from, we milk cows, drive trucks, and yes, even like baseball. So screw anyone that doesn't like it. Oh yeah, learn the difference between to and too city-boy! (see below) -thom unnumbered wanna-be member of the Bob Knepper Fan Club (BKFC)	9
I want All-Star Tickets does anyone know how I can get some? Are they for public sale or are they sold out? Or do you just have to work for a company with some Anyway any answers would be appreciated. Please E-mail me.	9
You're definitely correct in that Williams absolutely has to be sandwiched in between Clark and Bonds. He must, and I mean MUST, get fastballs to hit...otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise. What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds, Williams, and Clark 3-4-5, the reason being that I feel Bonds' potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he's stuck behind two slow runners. I think the chance of getting 20-30 extra stolen bases with Bonds in the 3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having Clark in the 5 spot.	9
TWINS UPDATE -- Posted April 22, 1993 --------------------------------------------- The Twins defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 5-4 today to conclude a three game homestand with the Brew crew. The Twins took two of three games in the series, with scores as follows: Tuesday April 20th MN 10 Mil 0 Winning Pitcher Banks (2-0) Wednesday April 21st Mil 10 (10) MN 8 LP - Hartley ( 0-1 ) Thursday April 22nd MN 5 Mil 4 WP - Deshaies (4-0) Sa - Aguilera Highlight/Low Lights of the Series: ------------------------------------ Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins, but of the American League as well. Going into today's game, Deshaies was 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning his ERA will climb slightly. Deshaies, who came to MN via a trade with Philadelphia which sent David West there, continues to make Andy MacPhail look like a true genius. Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins, going 6.1 innings on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting. Deshaies and Banks now combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories, while Tapani/Mahomes/Erickson are 0-5. Wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the Twins this year (Rickey Bones). The Twins teed off against both him and subsequent relief, including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead to 7-3. The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing 4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded. Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, Guthrie two walks, and Mike Hartley one walk before the inning was over. This tied the game at 7-7, and the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win it. Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew. 6 of 20 career blown saves have come against the Brew Crew, and today's game was shaky as well. Coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn, then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the side. Once again, the tying run made it to second base on Aggie. Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth. General News ------------------------------------- Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on Tuesday's game. He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching, though, which has limited his playing time. Gene Larkin and JT Bruett(former Gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed. The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow. Starting Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson, Mahomes, Banks. The Detroit Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff. The Twins have 9 HR's this year, three each from Puckett, Hrbek, and Winfield, the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively. Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second this year, and shows much improvement in this category. Jim Deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year. Some say he has the best 1st base move in baseball. This move has enabled him to pitch out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 start. Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the rubber on the pick-off move.

I know it's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let's give credit where credit is due. It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris. Last year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the other starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge, Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can't remember exactly). Also, let's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save the bullpen every fifth day. If he didn't help us win the AL east, forget about the pennent and the world series. His run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was Stottlemyer's (5.90 runs) and he won only 12 games. I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit. He pitched only as good as he needed to be. When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters "get themseleves out" (I hate this expression!). An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. But Morris, being a veteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball. By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra (I hate this too!) when the game was on the line. Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let's not change history to suit the present. BTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more can he be embarrassed? ditto!	9
[...] You could be right. Then again, you could be wrong. This claim is completely unverifiable and untestable. I'd wager most of the Braves fans on the net could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. You could give away tickets to Braves games. However, my Dad and I were able to get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign of a hot ticket... This is *precisely* why they were considered America's team. Even (especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the Braves games on cable. You could do that for the Cubs as well, but the Braves had better camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss the game, or Skip and Pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too* much worse. Because of TBS, the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia. At home in Kentucky, even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was as many Braves fans as Reds fans, even in 1990. You could actually watch the Braves play -- you had to go to Cincinnati to watch the Reds. I can go anywhere in America and watch the Braves. Why? I'd guess that Braves fans are more widely distributed than Toronto fans. -- Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic	9
[stuff deleted] I agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific argument. That "has great hands" means nothing. It seems to me that a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily) from his ability to field grounders or catch popups. How many such chances does he get during a game? Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B,SS,3B and P (I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals). This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line or in the dirt. "Good Hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have value. I don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays, but I'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar. It's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups. (But not as marked I suppose).	9

Williams does not like hitting cleanup!! Secondly, Bonds and Clark (in that order) are a lot more productive with runners in scoring position than Matt "I am streaky, free swinger" Williams.	9
Jason Lee asks: You must have heard wrong. His arm is still sore. He hasn't gone on the DL, but he may. Managmenet is treating him as a day-to-day situation. His doctors thought that he was ready, and they had him throw in Colorado, but his arm wasn't up to the strain. He is throwing every day, but he's just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet. (This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday, 4/23)	9
I definitely do. That's why I don't like going to see games played on artificial turf :-) Well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine. I think batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. I think the delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game. Of course, the umpires can, and should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand. As Ryan Robbins has pointed out, there are rules that cover this. One of the more fascinating things about baseball, I think, is its open-endedness with regard to time. You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to go on until four in the morning. Likewise, some games are action-packed, and some games are slow and lazy. That's fine by me. Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel- surf and cater to their short attention spans.	9
Like Clinton and Reno, I accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster. My wife and I picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox offense. Like all no-no's Bosio was good, lucky (hard grounder by Vaughn off T. Martinez' glove but straight to Boone who threw to Bosio at first, 3-4-1), and backed by good defense (many non-trivial groundouts). The game was amazingly fast, as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also working fast. The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch. Greenwell's mental stability is a serious concern (I guess it has always been, but his quirks were amusing back when he was an MVP candidate). Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently Johnson made an "ok, I've got to stay focused" gesture which Iron Mike interpreted as taunting), and struck out to heavy booing the next two times. As Valentine noted, last night he came up in the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game. Can you say "take the first pitch"? Not Mike, who dribbled it into a 6-4-3. The PI quoted Bosio that this was a "batting practice fastball". Next time up he also hit the first pitch, a hard liner straight to KGJr in center. He also made the pathetic error and failed to catch Boone's HR (which looked comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight reel that night). Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively? I couldn't tell from the field angle but his range looked bad, and he coughed a DP that cost a run or two. Why was he leadoff? I hope Fletcher gets well soon. Also on lineups, Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond me. It seemed to work, as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good defense (a wag behind us said "He sure don't want to go back to Calgary!") There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they'll likely lead off the second (as Boone did). Well, now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in Langston. A reminder that contest entries are open through next Wednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism. By the way, ties will be broken by earliest entry. One entry per person or pseudonym, please, and easy on the pseudonyms.	9
Of course you can. You just have to be careful about what conclusions you draw. Huh? The 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching. Grove, Vance, Dean, and not a whole lot else. As for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Greenberg, Hornsby, Cobb, etc. all played before the 40's. Stat-wise, the 60's were a graveyard for hitters. How do you know? Which ones do you consider great? So? Sheffield also has better shoes. More time between pitches. You can run the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account. Well, can we compare them or can't we? Why? We can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can keep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in despair. You haven't shown us what's *un*reasonable about the MAntle-Sheffield comparison that you yourself did.	9
Hey folks, Saw the Giants play ball at the 'Stick Saturday, April 17. It was the game where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out, two-run homer to right to win it. (It wasn't the game where the fans threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer -- too bad, huh?) Well, the 'Stick is still cold. The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it was cold then. I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick. The wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea. At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time. I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths the infield) and grab the trash. It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers. Everybody wins here! Whaddaya think?	9
Nice post Chuck, but you made just one mistake. Bones is a right-handed pitcher. However, Hrbek's grand slam came off Graehme Lloyd, a lefty.	9
You sure? This maybe a chronic syndrome. If it persists, we may have to banish you to the "Cub-crazy Sanatarium" in north Chicago... :-):-):-)	9
His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series. It may also be him pressing a little. As for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford. Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game against Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher. Good question. At least it doesn't appear that we are seeing the same Zeile :-)	9
(Eric Roush) writes... Funny. I didn't realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema in the first place. Thought it was someone named Jacobs. Why? If a statement is truly idiotic, and is universally thought so, the challenge is a waste of panting. Further, challenges that have nothing (yes, nothing) to do with *baseball* are wasting others' time. You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks? Let's hear it, in some sort of categorical manner. (Actually, I question whether either Knepper or Postema aren't "old news" at this point, although what I have read of Postema's book is interesting.) I agree this far. Sez you. That does not come out in what you say down the road, here. Yo. Even elementary school children have had access to our postings, albeit in an edited form. You want them to hear you talk like this? Don't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same? Or do you want them to think you're some politically correct demagogue who's oh-so sensitive? (Ho-hum.) Plus, you're here limiting free speech to "some obscure newsgroup that I don't read." What BS. You got a problem with what Jacobs says, what Knepper thinks, all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas, more and better speech. Yours is the easy way out. As for Knepper: ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them? You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't pre-prepared. They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women, they pop some question about Postema. (An interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same game. Off the top of my head, I guess "no." If my guess is right, Knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it, and he doesn't.) Now, why didn't *I* think of that? :-) :-) :-) RG	9
[...details deleted...] Oh, great. We fans can subsidize the cost of speeding up the games that we don't want to see sped up. Terrific. Oh. I forgot.

I hate to be so sarcastic on such a beautiful day.)	9
: I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the : game. Let's be serious. The relief pitcher has normally been : throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes. Does he really need 8 : more pitches? If the relief pitcher didn't get 8 pitches, there wouldn't be enough time to: 1) Play "Hit The Road Jack" 2) The Iron City Relief Pitcher Commercial 3) The announcers to detail to us exactly what drove the previous one from the game 4) A detailed biography, both personal and statistical, of the new guy throwing his 8 pitches. 5) Get really cool super-slo-mo pictures for Diamond Vision to put up by said pitchers name and stats!	9
Warren, I agree with your premise... but... The Babe won on two teams. That's right, he was part of the Red Sox Dynasty of the 1910s. And everyone knows that the Yankee Dynsaty wouldn't have happened without thier famous bullpen catcher whose name escapes me at the moment.	9
[...] Tim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball. Deion can be explained as "learning how to play the game". I'm not betting that Deion will be able to play as well as last year, but I think the odds of Deion playing as well or better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon doing the same thing. When you factor in defense, Otis was more valuable last year. But I'm not convinced he'll be more valuable this year, and especially next year. -- Dale J.

Yes. It was the strangest series I have ever watched. And the ending fit perfectly.	9
Hey! What's this? We agree! No platoon advantage (Sabo vs. Samuel). Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters, and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups. Sabo has more power, and a little bit of a better batting eye. Samuel is noted as an agressive free-swinger. Sabo has more homerun power. Both players started the game hitting below .200. There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later. But the game *was* on the line, and Samuel never did get in. Given all of this, I don't see a lot to suggest pinch-hitting, nor do I see anything to suggest no pinch-hitting. There is, of course, the clutch-hitting information. But if that's useless... Then again. If it's not...	9
No way -- gotta be Walter Johnson. All were with Washington. Carlton spent too long in St. Louis to collect less than 700 there. I'd also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect Bobby Witt wasn't far behind. Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close.... Fingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so, yes, I'd go with that guess. Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better chance of having 100 with MIN along with (I would think) easily reaching 100 with MON. Gotta be Willie Mays...I am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his career. Hmmm...Leary is a really good point. I'd forgotten about him. Well, if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-Met pitchers in the category of "could have lost to all teams" -- Koosman, Leary, Torrez, Ryan, Seaver.... I guess the best three guesses would be Leary, Ryan, and either Seaver or Koosman.	9

Gant's ML record Age 28 this season. Year G AB BA OBP SLG HR SB CS 1987 21 83 .265 .271 .386 2 4 2 1988 146 563 .259 .317 .439 19 19 10 <-- 3rd Base Expt. year 1989 75 260 .177 .237 .335 9 9 6 1990 152 575 .303 .357 .539 32 33 16 1991 154 561 .251 .338 .496 32 34 15 1992 153 544 .259 .321 .415 17 32 10 In the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time approx 4.5 seasons. Just looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800, which is pretty good for an OF. His 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B. The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989. When he returned as an OF, he began hitting again. And of course, last year he slumped. But no learning curve? He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years, as well as his SB/CS ratio. As to his fielding, he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system, and then the Braves put him through 2 position changes in the space of a year. He's an adequate OF, although not great, and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level. (I know you're another long-term Braves fan :) About playing 3B...IMO, that's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field, after catcher. At SS or 2B, you need more range and speed, but at 3B, you've got to have quick reflexes and have a GUN for an arm. There are NO second chances at 3B, even when playing sandlot softball! Granted, I'd still put my best overall infielder at SS, but that's because he gets more chances, not because the job is harder. It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B. But maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3B is scarce. Finally, Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well, and works hard to improve. You don't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work. Now, whether he's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat. But frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential, I'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not trying hard enough. You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult; but at that age I don't believe you can teach hustle. All that said, I don't think I'd sign Gant to another long-term contract. He's 28 now, and I think he's free-agent eligible in 2 years, when he'll be 30. Given his career curve and limitations, I wouldn't expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer. He might surprise me here, but Atlanta's got some talent on the farm, and I'd rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al.	9
Ugliest swing..I am not sure. I think the ugliset stance is Jolio Franco of the Ranger. I wonder how that bat comes around in time to hit the ball. It looks bad but hey.it get the job done.	9
Let's not forget Al Michaels, of "Do you believe in miracles?" fame.	9
I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order. Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs (unlike last year). Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle. Since Matt has a terrible batting eye, this helps the Giants a lot. When Bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson, Manwaring, or Clayton. If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a big inning. Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double). The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds... and I think that's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot.	9
The *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams: For all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10 minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5 hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500). For all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120. (If the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to first he would get $7500). I suspect you could finance this the same way Presidential campaigns are paid for. Offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says "I want 5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses"...	9
Okay, I'll bite. How can OBP be *lower* than batting average? Sac flies or something?	9
They lowered the mound first (before the 69 season). The shrinkage of the strike zone didn't start until the mid-70s.	9
I really don't want to get into a DidSo-DidNot debate with you. But this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement. I did not say, nor did I imply, that I could predict the future. You have inferred that my comments meant this, and you have based your rebuttal of my comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in regard to clutch hitting. Sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228 Samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299 That is *your* opinion that Sabo is "clearly a better hitter" than Samuel. The above data is for a 4-year period ending last season. Last season Samuel batted .272 while Sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted). This season they are both hitting below .200, albeit Sabo with more at bats. I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better hitter than Samuel, but I will also remind you that Samuel has been a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo. I did not predict that Sabo would choke, nor that Samuel would get a hit. I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager (or even a Reds fan) that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that situation than Sabo. Ah. "properly". Yes. I see. Please help me. What, exactly, is "everything else" that pointed to Sabo? I must say, I was not aware of the publication. Can you email me the information regarding its availability? And I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive study on, say, supply side economics. I didn't mean to insult you. But I never did believe you were on the right path. I'm sorry for my contrary opinion/position. I also regret that I don't have the ability to prove that you are wrong. But you are. It is what it says it is! The "second" is *your* statement, not mine. Well, actually, I haven't yet. But I'm not finished looking. That is, I haven't yet found someone who hit significantly below his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 1989 - 91, and then reversed that relationship in 1992. Nope. Sorry. But if you were interested in a reason why I expect Chris Sabo's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could. If you were interested in a reason why I expect Joe Carter's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one year to the next, I think I could. But you're not interested in that, because you think that those conclusions could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire baseball population. And they can't be. The problem here is that I *do* believe you. I accept your work. I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based on prior clutch history is meaningless. No better than a coin toss. I actually *do* accept your work. As it happens, I also have an *opinion* that in certain situations, for certain players, a history of superior or inferior ability to hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be valid in projecting future player performance. For that player. And Chris Sabo is one such player. Well, since I defer to your statistical wisdom, I think I must have an open mind. Now we have to pose the same question to you. -- The Beastmaster	9
However, batters didn't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree they do now. Everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games. The rule that Hirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time. Nobody, including Hirschbeck, ever said he was. That's your (perhaps colored by your partisanship of the Braves) perception. Hirschbeck's view was that Gant was heading off for a long walk, and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up, directed him into the batter's box. The point is, based on the rulebook and the umpires' instructions, it was *not* an unreasonable request. The Braves were already upset Had Gant done as instructed, you wouldn't have remembered the name of the umpire.	9

Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football. Last year I hardly watched a game. What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game. A team scores. 2.5 minutes of commercials. Kickoff. 1.5 minutes of commercials. Three downs and a punt. 2 minutes of commercials. AAAAARRRRGH! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A's, whom I believe institutionalize slow play. I don't mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first; in fact, I rather enjoy it. Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first. What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first, or when the game is a blowout. I don't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation, or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration. What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. When a game is exciting, these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game. When the delays happen with regularity, they become nuisances, just like the commercial breaks in football. I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to "speed up" the games, basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster. That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game. It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks, but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans. Similary, while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears, those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch. I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out. I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present. I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball. On the other hand, I wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful enough to sit down with Alderson/LaRussa/Duncan and explain that they are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games out the way that they do. I sure wouldn't mind a little arm-twisting there. -- The Beastmaster	9

Your list of Jewish ballplayers includes Levi Samuel Meyerle (son of Jacob and Margaret Meyerle). Although that sounds like a Jewish name, Meyerle's "surviving relatives" say he wasn't Jewish, according to "Nineteenth Century Stars," published by SABR in 1989. Incidentally, "Long Levi" (he was 6-foot-1) batted .492 in the first season of the National Association, the first pro league. Needless to say, he hasn't been topped yet. (Of course, the NA is not considered a "major" league by officialdom.) Over five seasons, Meyerle hit .368 in the NA. He also played for the first three seasons of the NL, hitting .329. -- -------------------------- Phil Brown | aka pb6755@csc.albany.edu |	9
I don't actually have the answer to this one. Bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a "back-end" perfect game. How many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games? The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie Shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in Cooperstown. Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; Shore picked him off and retired 26 straight after that.

This is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. In fact, there's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins. For the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save: He must finish the game and either 1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck. 2. have pitched at least three innings effectively. A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game. But this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves. This again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your post. Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com	9
Ugliest stance of all time has to go to Oscar Gamble. The man would practically kneel in front of home plate in order to have a small strike zone! (He's just lucky that strike zone size isn't determined by how big your afro is:)	9
It depends. If, in the judgment of the umpire the batter made no attempt to avoid getting hit, the batter is awarded first for a base on balls. If the umpire rules he did try to get out of the way, he's awarded first because of a hit batsman. Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine	9

Last year my nine year old son fell in love with baseball and now likes to play and to follow the professionals. I would like to buy him a board game so he can catch a glimpse of and practise a little of the managerial stragegy. I am not looking for a computer game or any type of game where manual dexterity determines the winner. I am after something that he and his friends can spread out over a table on a rainy day and spend some thoughtful time over. I would appreciate the names of any recommended games.

Actually, I was hoping for Barry Bonds. Oh well. First off, Jeff has had like 5 hits in the last two games, and walked *yet again*. Sorry Ken, but Jeff King does have some power, which means his SLG won't be below .300, and his walks are *way* up. If that increase is real, Jeff King will be an above average NL third baseman in 1993. Jose Lind, on the other hand, *still* doesn't walk, and clearly isn't a .320 hitter. My bet is that he won't be getting any extra bases either once everybody starts pulling the "Lind Shift" we were seeing in the NL. No, although since the Lavalliere weirdness, nothing would really surprise me. Jeff King is currently in the top 10 in the league in *walks*. Something is up...	9

Attendance in 1992 was down. By .3%. From an all-time record in 1991. In people terms, attendance was down by 310,000 from 1991 to 1992. Two franchises, the Dodgers and Mets, were down by 1,100,000 from 1991 to 1992. Had either of them not been entirely awful, MLB would have set another attendance record in 1992.

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy (name possibly garbled by me), an official historian for the CIA. She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary (which I know from nothing but which sounds good). She said that among other things, Berg was the principal spy for the OSS (CIA's WWII precursor) spying on Axis atomic programs, because of his physics background and language skills. She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland, and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him). (I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program, but I don't know how reliable this is.) Unfortunately, NPR didn't mention any kind of a book she's writing -- I'd certainly buy it. (In case you're wondering about baseball relevance, Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher. He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured Japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans, much less MLB players, who spoke Japanese. Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids, according to McCarthy.)	9
I suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning. An outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles. However, a fielder who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles. Has anyone seen these players' positioning? Do Butler and Felix play deep, and Lankford, Martinez, and Wilson shallow, or is this a park effect? I thought Butler liked to play shallow.	9

Besides, Bonds : _wants_ to bat 5th I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell. Wouldn't that show that Williams does better at 5th rather than 4th? The point is moot, though, becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd and, like you point out, Bonds does like to bat 5th. The only person left to bat 4th is Williams.	9

It was the game where Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out, two-run homer to right to win it. (It wasn't the game where the fans threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer -- too bad, huh?) Well, the 'Stick is still cold. The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it was cold then. I can't imagine night games in April at the 'Stick. The wind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea. At most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on the field a lot of the time. I propose a Kid's Clean-up Corps composed mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths the infield) and grab the trash. It might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given anything to be on the field with the ballplayers. Everybody wins here! Whaddaya think?	9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As far as I know, a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or beyond, and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game. For example If it is the bottom of the 8th inning and Clemens is pithching. The Red Sox are leading 4-1 and Clemens has just givin up a hit. So, there is a man on first, the batter, and the batter on deck could tie the game with a homer. If Jeff Russel came in, (The Red Sox reliever), and finished the game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score, he would get the save and Clemens would get the win. Thats how I beleive it works.	9

This comes up periodically, and I just don't get it. Take, for example, Mark McGwire. He walked 90 times in 1993. If that's not a potential great example of what you're talking about then I don't know what is. Now let's look at what happens when McGwire doesn't walk: 75% of the time he made an out. 10% of the time he hit a single. 5% of the time he hit a double. 10% of the time he hit a homer. Now, you're pitching against McGwire. Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers, 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? I would. Why give him the base when you can get him out 3 times out of 4? Then there are guys like Alex Cole, who has a career .363 OBP even though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in 227 AB in 1990) or hit a single home run. Yep, that's right, he's *never* hit a homer in 916 AB's through the end of 1992. Who'd be afraid to throw a strike to him? Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com	9
Disclaimer -- This is for fun. In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not make with average effort." Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as "Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made." OK, I realize that's unfair. Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor. But let's put it this way: If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by? To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make. By the same method I've calculated Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by). Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->. Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the player's total contribution to the team. So don't take it too seriously. The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.

Basically, it's designed to be added into the OPS, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored". The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG. That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

You started it... You most certainly did! Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel. Yet you would pinch-hit Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and Sabo will be a choke hitter. Right? I'd call that "predicting the future". Right. I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past. Overall performance, L/R splits, even matching hitting/pitching styles. All of these will give me some advantage if used properly. EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL, there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance. And in this case, everything else pointed to Sabo. That comes down to the same thing. When Perez left Sabo in, he was predicting the future, the next AB. He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel. By supporting the swap, you are predicting the opposite. Well, yes. You are aware of its existance. You claim to be incapable of understanding it (though I suspect you are simply unwilling). Yet you rather forcefully state the opposite. You don't seem to think the work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important). I'd say this is insulting. RIGHT! This is the beef. It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances. At least none that we've been able to come up with. If you know of some where it *is* an indicator of future performance, please let us in on your secret. Most certainly. As I have repeatedly stated, if you can come up with a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability, I would love it! However the straightforward attempts at such a study have all failed miserably. Well, it was a stupid argument. (Are you honestly debating that???) Sure, we know Sabo didn't get a hit. We have no idea whether Samuel would have done any better or not. One AB most certainly doesn't prove anything! Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year? Or is this a prediction for *all* batters who have, over the past few years, hit (xxx amount?) worse in the clutch than overall? If you mean the first, then as you say, we'll just have to wait and see. But the second is a much stronger statement. In fact, it suggests a rule. We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years. I think you will agree that if the rule didn't work last year or the year before, that it is unlikely to do any better this year. Right? I'm not going to get into case analysis. Sure, you can find somebody who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. You can also find those who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit *well* in '92. Gambler's fallacy. Unless there is reason to expect consistency, a run proves nothing. Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to correlate from one year to the next? I've seen a detailed study of why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate. The "stupid" was in reference to a statement which *was* stupid. (And I don't see how you can deny it.) As for "total idiot"? Yes. If you prove yourself unwilling to even *consider* evidence that might suggest that you are wrong, I would say the term fits nicely. So tell me? Does the term fit? Or do you have an open mind?	9
[...] Actually, according to the DA information posted by Sherri, Boggs is superior defensively to have. Here's their Defensive Averages for the last five years: [compared to average at 3b, AL] 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 Boggs .643[+2] .659[+47] .550[-54] .653[+33] .634[+32] Hayes ------- .601[-40] .622[+18] .606[-14] .574[-28] If Hayes is a defensive standout at third, he's done a good job in disguising it. To put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year: Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and prevented 11 doubles. Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and prevented 4 doubles. -- Dale J. Stephenson |*| (steph@cs.uiuc.edu) |*| Baseball fanatic	9
Hey guys, who is this Jack Morris fella ?????? ONLY JOKING !!!!! But try to lighten up will ya ? The season's only just started and everyone's apoplectic. If all you statheads out there are trying to justify how Morris is doing at the moment, just remember that we're talking about a very small sample size. There is a helluva long way to go, so sit back and enjoy the ride.	9
Right. Most definitely. This may be the root of the confusion... Please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind. Note that I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the question at hand. Suppose we have a simplified Lotto game. You pick a number from 1-10 and win if that number is drawn. Suppose we have a large population of people who play this game every week. In the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population will win 7 or more times. In the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again be 7-time winners. In the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in each of the first two years will win 7 again. Suppose I started with 1024 people in my population. After three years, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last three years, won 140% or more the number of times expected. Do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game? No. Because we know there is no skill involved. Nothing about these "consistent winners" can influence their chances of winning. But suppose we *don't* know whether or not there is a chance that skill might be involved. Perhaps some of the people in our population are psychic, or something. How would we test this hypothesis? We can look for correlations in the population. Now most of the population will show zero correlation. But our psychics should show a high positive correlation (even if they aren't very good psychics, they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years). Net result? A small positive correlation over the entire population. Well, zero correlation is zero correlation. You mention that Sabo has hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years. But if we look at the past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse as they are to remain consistent. The length of the streak doesn't seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be clutch or choke the next year. Is there any reason to expect *this* streak to be different from past streaks? Now if it were true that "75% of all three-year streaks remained true to form", then we might have something useful. But then we wouldn't have zero correlation. Instead we have "50% of all three-year streaks remain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse". You look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to choke this year". But it would be equally valid to look at those numbers and say "three year choke streak implies more likely to be clutch this year", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each way. Then we would have something useful. And we would also have a positive correlation. But for every individual that exhibits such a pattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern and then reverses.	9

Do you remember Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS, after the Dodgers defeated the Mets, and Ugh-a-dugh foo-boo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out on to the field in celebration? YUCK!!!!!! He undulated. His arms flew up and down, keeping time with his rolling set of 9 stomachs, which flew all around the cozy confines of Chavez Ravine. He oozed, like a white gastropod. He ran. It was a disgusting sight. Not only couldn't I watch my Mets in the Series, I had to watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger.... BLARGH! "If you like short, fat men, who grunt, curse, and spit a lot, Whitey's certainly your man" - Former WFAN host Pete Franklin, on The White Rat ... But it's true, this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary physique. Looking at Charlie Hough's scrawny torso through those tight white shirts just sort of makes me decide, "Hmmm, I don't want to eat lunch today...or tomorrow...or anytime soon...". When Al Harazin first became Mets' GM, he was asked if he intended to help redesign the Mets' uniforms and change their image. In particular, they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the sides the uniforms. He said that he's very much in favor of keeping them because "they're sleek and they're sexy". Sid Fernandez, in a tight-fitting uniform, with a sleek racing stripe to denote speed and potencty. Mmmmmmmm...lard. Kevin McReynolds, diving after a fly ball. Mmmmmmmm...Man O' War, baby! Pat Howell....well, never mind. Nothing could be tight on him. They don't make uniform sizes *that* small ... :-)	9
Do you have a better e-mail address, Mr. Lurie? I'm afraid I can't get the short version to work. In any case, on Winfield. Yes, his career BA is a mere .285. He didn't beat this until his sixth year in the majors, and has only topped it once since 1988. His peak was in the early '80s, and included some rather impressive seasons. But then he's also had other scattered great performances (like 1988 and 1992). Definitely *not* a smooth career curve!	9
As the heading indicates, it is impossible for me to fathom why Barry is not batting 4th for the Giants behind Will Clark. Barry is such an awesome and consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the National League. IMHO, to have Williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting 4th ahead of Bonds is simply an injustice to the Giants and fans of the Giants.	9
So, which one will officially be the end of the world? ;) I can see the end of the WS now: "Well folks, here it is. Bottom of the ninth; bases loaded; Full count on Sandberg in this 1-1 game. Clemens winds, heres the pitch. Swung on and it is a line drive to center. Zupcic moves to his left. He's there and..... *****ZOT******	9
A guy who threw 240 innings with about .6 run lower ERA would have saved the bullpen even more. Say, somebody like Frank Viola (238 innings). Nice audition tape. Send it to: Baseball Tonight ATTN: Ray Knight ESPN Bristol, CT Have you, by chance, taken a look at the boxscores from last year to determine the accuracy of your account? I seem to recall Morris getting at least 3 or 4 wins last year when the Jays came back from behind after they had decided to pull Morris at the end of an inning.

funny, it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks, which are nothing BUT collections of statistics, are authored by "bill james and stats inc. (and howe, for the minor league handbook)". and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies as a "book with statistics", while the elias analyst is a "statistics book". the analyst contains more stats, sure, but it also contains more dialogue. finally, the point was not about the word "statistics". it was about "money-grubbing". i don't see how anyone who has looked at the bill james player ratings book cannot consider him money-grubbing.	9

Cardinals for poor Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to question the notion that "sitting a rested player down" has any real effect on his long-term performance. Sure, if a man is tired and needs real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act. Perhaps if a man is mentally "strained", then sitting him down might help to the extent that that helps him relax. But I would like to suggest that in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.	9
If there is a "USA Today ftp site" could someone please post it to the newsgroup so everyone will stop posting the "send it to me too" articles. I'm sure many people woulds like to know so why not just post it to the net rather than mailing hundreds of people. Just a thought. Thanks, Ryan Robin.	9
To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current heights. You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year. Then you must predict either: (1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or (2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year. So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as "13-13" (resend it if you were serious, Val!). ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place. So email me your guess, either at "barring@cs.washington.edu" or directly replying to this post. Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993.	9

I don't think that it is "obvious" that "lots" of people are willing to pay the price. I'm sure someone out there in net-land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold. But even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider what is happening on a team-by-team basis. When the TV money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources. One of the best sources may be ticket sales. Example 1: The Dodgers The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise prices without hindering revenues. I certainly think that is true. Example 2: The Padres They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year. If they raise prices, less. If they want to increase their overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a winning team on the field. But given that won't happen (it won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket prices and running frequent promotions. Will they do that? I have no idea. But they won't increase prices, because it won't work *for them*. The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place. Each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces. As a buiness manager, I would never *want* to lower my prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works. You have to consider everything if you want continued success. -- The Beastmaster	9
I'll go with Mark Grace, and in 2 years, Frank Thomas.	9
Pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off) within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15. Pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends, not two minutes. And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is simple: Different mound, different catcher. Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine	9
Does anyone know the status of Jeffries or Arocha?	9
Okay, I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a strike or two and try to get on base any way they can. So the "No Power/Impatient" guys have no excuse. The "No Power/Patient" guys are doing the right thing. Now the "Impatient/Power" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?). Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches? Perhaps, but I doubt it. If you tell Joe Carter to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive. The "Patient/Power" guys? Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" so they get their walks based on the small zone. Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams. Wow! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them. The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.	9
IMHO this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all of baseball. My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on-deck circle. Also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot excede three runs. I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners/savers/etc. For instance, a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win. Has this pitcher earned a win, no way. I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score. Assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth. His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. The third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" satisfaction. Mike	9
[some deletions] Well, we agree on the last part.:-) One of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. A player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. A player's ability to walk or infielder's Defensive Average are correlated better. That is to say, given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year. Put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better. One of the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. Adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much. As a counterexample to what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987: Non-Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 Lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 If you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch" situations, you'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye. Well, in 1988, Maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while Lemon hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch". Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch" at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias). As a simple measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88, 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were above in one and below in the other. If you were just flipping coins, you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched. The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant. BTW, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at something better than the 99.9% confidence level. Correlating their (clutch-non-clutch BA) for the same period gives a correlation of 0.088, significant at no level of any interest. Actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future clutch performance. It's more correct to say that we can't predict future clutch performance with any skill. Harold	9
Dayley's salary was guarenteed...with Wells the Jays were only on the hook for 25%(?) of it. Give Jackson a break...he lost about 10 pounds with that flu he had when he was traded. I would rather have Molitor than Winfield...Winfield was just hogging all the credit, and he was trying to soak the Jays for a 3 year guarenteed contract... The Jays pitching can only get better...Molitor and Alomar haven't hit anything yet...and the Jays are still over .500...	9
Im trying to find a site that has UPDATED(daily) stats more the National league. I'll take both leagues but I'm really interested in the National league.	9
I agree. I'll delete more as well. Still, if the 'whispers' reached San Francisco, it is certainly possible they were stronger elsewhere. Also, it was teammates making the aspersions. In any event, I know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years. Uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por- trayed differently by "the media", and towards this, he gave a highly selected list to "prove" his case. Sanders' name showed up eventually. I dispute that Sanders has ever been called lazy by "the media". Uh, that poster specifically stated "allow me to be the first". It is NOT a quibble, then, to state that "the media" did not portray Canseco as being lazy. If the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not make it a quibble. And in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his time in the wieght room. Hardly "lazy", and hardly a "quibble". Have you ever seen any "mediot" portray Canseco as "lazy"? Unconcerned with his fielding, yes. Lazy, no. Well, Canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. Clemens had a run-in at a bar. Canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the coverage was relatively minimal. Uh, if the only evidence offered is anecdotal, how can it be objected that the counter to it is also anecdotal? Uh, yes, and I agree with your assesment of Boggs, rather specifically. However, you did say "everybody who has ever won a batting title" has been accused of selfishness. I have not ever, anywhere, heard this said of Puckett. Pendleton, either. Similarly, Brett, B Williams, and others. There are others. Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken, except in the case of the "born-again" types I mention.	9
I'm a little worried about this pitching thing. 6.08 is scarry even for the first 16 games of the season. Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. He pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him. I got a chance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well also. Then the dam broke. Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1. (3 run homer by Snow?). I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are pitchers. Anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they are? The TRIBE is on ESPN again tonight against Oakland.	9
BASEBALL.....ALWAYS how he	9
So, that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays *should* keep Alfredo Griffin, just because it "worked"? A team winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is right. A team not winning doesn't mean that everything that it's doing is wrong, or otherwise (to borrow the Sharks' situation) you would say that George Kingston should be fired. By then, it's too late. The problem with "not fixing something while it's working" is that by then, there may not be anything left to fix. So, the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year; there was nothing that they could have done to have improved that team. NOT.	9
And it is not Hirschbeck's job to help Gant with any of these difficulties. If Gant can't gather his concentration for whatever reason, that just makes him all the more meat in the batter's box. The umpire's job is to maintain flow of play. Gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties. Nor is anyone else. Absolutely. I think it'd be more accurate to say Gant was foolish. If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout, games would last about nine-fifteen weeks, if Jack Morris or Dave "Whiner" Stieb were pitching. A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out. Suck it up, get back in the box, and never badmouth the blue. They're not going to change their mind, and you're just going to come across as a pinhead, which won't help you with the borderline calls. FTR - I never speak to umpires when I don't know them personally, nor do I glance at them, or react to calls. As a result, I think I get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate, because I have a rep of having a good eye. (Actually, there are a lot of negative connotations that go with that rep, including copious questions about my masculinity, party affiliation, and sexual preference.) Irrelevant. He was wasting time THEN. 1. Because it's not his job. 2. Because setting the precedent of cutting slack THERE can easily extend to those 3 hour games. (Kind of like the phantom DP.) Gant hurt himself, and the Braves disrupted the game. Your biases are exposed, and I'm sitting here defending umpires and the SF Giants, which is like Phyllis Schlafly defending Gary Segura, Jack Kevorkian, and the Swedish Abortion Team. I believe Terry said the magic word. There are some truly quick ways to get tossed from a ballgame. For a primer, email me. Good ways to get tossed from a game: 1. Ask Ken Kaiser if he got his money back from Nutri-System. 2. Kiss Rich Garcia on the lips, and say "Hi, Honey, I'm Home!" 3. Goose Eric Gregg. 4. Ask Bruce Froemming if his parents had any children that lived. 5. Get Naked. (Source: The Greg Spira Book of Diamond Ettiquette, as told to Peter Gammons. 1991, Collier Press.)	9
I didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like McGwire, Bonds, and Frank Thomas was rational. I just said that it exists. I don't know Alex Cole's batting style at all. Some questions: How tall is he? Does he go into a crouch like Rickey Hederson/Pete Rose? Does he foul off a lot of pitches like Brett Butler? Does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat? It could be the Cole has a good batting "eye". Look above, I said that *many* high OBP guys draw their walks because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not "all" high OBP guys.	9
But it is subject to all kinds of bias, and is almost completely useless for first basemen. From the raw stats, there is no way to tell which of a first baseman's putouts were made on throws from other fielders, and which were made on his own plays; likewise, you can't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3. Fielding Runs thus gives a first baseman no credit for putouts or double plays, only for assists and errors. It thus favors first basemen who play deep, reaching a lot of balls but forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently. It also hurts first baseman who play behind left-handed pitching staffs and thus face few left-handed batters. This is better; of course, it still isn't all of a first baseman's defense. Defensive Average, which uses larger (and probably better) zones, has Mattingly tied for second in the league. While 233 batting runs is good, it is mostly in the past; the runs he produced in 1986 don't say much about his value in 1993.	9
[argument over "reasonable" players and umpires deleted] Yes, but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a strike. There was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal. Once he called it a strike the call could not be changed. I thought that the umpire did the right thing.	9
I know, you all were saying "Ha! The Braves score a few runs for Maddux, that'll shut that guy up." But no, I think we'll just keep track a bit longer... Last outing: 5 runs. Total to date: 8 runs, 4 games Braves record in Maddux's starts: 2-2 See ya next time. Dennis	9
Viola has only played in the NL with the Mets -- not possible for him to have defeated or lost to every team. Ditto for Tanana who was mentioned in a previous post. I don't remember if Seaver managed to get a win against the White Sox in his brief sojourn with Boston so I'd say the other pitcher to defeat every team is either Mike Torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period of time) or Koosman as mentioned. I would also guess that if one of these two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team. Tom	9

The best one I saw last year was Willie McGee off Matthews (I think?) in Phillie. A fierce line drive that was still rising when it hit thE second deck facade at the Vet. Willie McGee had one homerun last year.	9
Bob, sex is already ALL OVER baseball! Do you think those uniforms can get ANY TIGHTER?? Todd Hundley's could be, I suppose; he seems to favor the Carlton Fisk baggy-pants style. Very unfortunate. Todd, word to the wise: if ya got it, flaunt it!	9
As will I, and the Ultimate Lurker.	9
We cannot isolate completely, Roger, but we can make a pretty good estimate. I won't claim to split hairs and say that we can really measure who was better, Robby Alomar or Carlos Baerga, last year; the difference is too close to call. But Larkin and Lee? Clemens and Morris? The differences are too great there. In your measure of the game, why should a team that has just won it all ever replace a single player? Since they are now clearly "best", how can they do better? Yet every team can always find someplace where they beleive they can improve the team; they can always find a player a little better than one they already have. (BTW, by my definitions, the "best" player is the one who does the most things to help his team win. I will allow that this could vary depending on who else is on the team, by having aptitudes one team needs more than others.) Baseball is a team game, but it is made of individual talents. It is absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success or failure of his teammates, whom he did not choose (at least in most cases.) Morris won last year because he played on a team with Joe Carter, Robby Alomar, Tom Henke, Juan Guzman, John Olerud, et al. Clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as Herm Winninham, Luis Rivera, and Jeff Reardon. To define the quality of the team as a sum of its components (as I do, albeit imperfectly) is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you do)	9

On a cold, damp night last night at Tiger Stadium, Dave Wells, David Haas, Bob MacDonald, and Mike Henneman combined for a 3-1 victory over the Texas Rangers. Here are the highlights: R H E Texas 1 4 1 Detroit 3 5 0 Wells gets the win, he's now 3-0 with an ERA just under 1, and Henneman gets his third save in three chances. Ken Rogers started for the Rangers and gets the loss. He was relieved by Burns in the 7th. The Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th. The Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd, then took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted reliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton. Whitaker in turn crossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips (who has been red hot) for the third Tiger run. This afternoon, it's another battle of southpaws, Bill Krueger for the Tigers vs. Craig Lefferts for the Rangers. --Randy	9

Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team? Who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers? (Hint: Nolan Ryan isn't either) What two pitchers have over 100 career saves for two different teams? Who is the only player to hit 300 or more career home runs and steal 300 or more career bases for the same team? No fair peeking at your baseball stats....	9
My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85. I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out. First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present). How many Cy Youngs does Morris have? How many Cy youngs does Clemens have? Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park. Detroit, hugh hitters paradise. Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold. If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris snaps the ball, and throw for Ks. Otherwise, he just tries to get people out. As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to when he doesn't pitch. How bad would the Red sox have been last year without him? Can you say 92 Phillies? I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi great tenacity. Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen, but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.	9
Since Roger is a Canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball I am gonna try to explain it to him in terms of hockey... according to his logic... I can say that since 1988...Bob Errey is better than Wayne Gretzky hey...Errey contributed to 2 Cups while good old Wayne has won nothing... (I think the Kings should trade Gretzky for Errey....what do you think Roger?)	9
Well then given your definition of "best" is it not conceivable that Alfredo Griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs to win while Larkin might not have that something the team needs? Would Griffin then be better than Larkin? No, I am not trying to define the quality of an individual, at least not for the purpose of ranking them. Toronto won with Olerud. They might have won with Fielder. They might not have won with Thomas. Detroit might have won with Thomas. Chicago might have won with Fielder. You can't rank these individuals. You can only look at who might contribute more to the team effort, which is winning the WS. Thomas could not have contributed to that goal any more than Olerud so I cannot say that Olerud is less of a player. --	9
According to an article in the LA Times, Todd Worrell will not be ready to come off the DL list Friday. It sounds like he has had another set back in his come back. At present, he has stopped throwing the ball. Supposedly, he had no velocity. It doesn't sound like there is any particular time table at this point for when he will be back.	9
The Phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings. Last night's game was hard fought. The game in Chicago should have been a blow out. All in all these two games show a different Phillies team. In past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run games. I don't know how many times I saw them losing by only 1 run. If they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of a contending team. They are 3-0 so far in extra innings. And of course, they are 10-3.	9
I couldn't agree more. The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up. So far pitching has been the biggest problem. Maybe we can get Acker back? :-) One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse. Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air, waving a big towel over his head. He looked like a big jerk, especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season. The next day, Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started. The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's jeep. Bell really freaked out. I don't think Bell was to popular after that. I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now. He's known for being a great outfielder, and he's not the only Blue Jay who has been booting balls and playing generally awful. andrew	9
I beg to differ, he had a couple 3 hit games after he came back. He did get caught stealing though. He also missed sunday's game. Did he play tonight? If not, I'm worried. He's on my team too.	9

I think there is another formula for ERA. I heard something about it last year. Im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab. It allows for a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched... ERA = (ER*27)/outs recorded Like i said, im not sure this is exactly it, but im pretty sure they changed it to something of the sort.	9
Well, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net with his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me. The way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth, and I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6; 1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks substantially right. In the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is "Billy Ripken". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded off for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have: Randy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo Gomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271) in left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh. So, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of batting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55, 30 batting, 25 fielding. Total RAR (bat/field) 1. Bonds 152 (124/28) Ventura 124 (66/58) 2. Sandberg 143 (88/55) Thomas 122 (110/12) 3. Van Slyke 122 (91/31) Anderson 109 (75/34) 4. Grace 114 (70/44) Raines 100 (68/32) 5. Lankford 111 (76/35) Puckett 98 (76/22) 6. Pendleton 108 (71/37) Alomar 98 (75/23) 7. Finley 104 (70/34) Martinez E 97 (81/16) 8. Bagwell 101 (73/28) Mack 93 (70/23) 9.

Bell 79 (42/37) Gonzalez 73 (60/13) Notable entries in a per-400 batting out rating, NL: top 7 are Bonds, 177, LF; Sandberg, 130, 2b; Van Slyke, 114, cf; Grace, 107, 1b; Larkin, 102, ss; Justice, 99, rf; Sheffield, 99, 3B. One at each position measured! McGriff, despite +85 batting RAR, fifth in league, finishes out of the top 20 due to a -13 in fielding. Last by position: Galarraga 39, Stillwell -10, Hansen 30, Belliard 30 (Blauser gad a 69, 3rd in league), May 43, Dascenzo 34, Anthony 38. In the AL, much-maligned Rickey Henderson was worth 120, second only to Frank Thomas' 124; Ventura edges Edgar at third, 116-111; Grebeck rates a potent 102!; Griffey edges Puckett as top CF, 93-90; Listach nudges out Lofton among rookies, 82-80. And Alomar clearly outpoints Baerga, 97-73. Last by position: Segui 10, Sojo 29, Palmer 22, Lewis 31, Polonia 40, Cuyler 26, V. Hayes 39. All for now.	9
I looked up "might" to see why you selected that particular word, and discovered the line ". . . to express permission, liberty, probability, possibility . . ." It also said something about being a "polite" alternative to "may." The presence of "probability, possibility" can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection. So, I'd say to all extents and purposes, "Yes, you might." In fact, you did. (Not that you were asking *me* specifically.) The next question is, why would a mailing list be "more" appropriate? We don't all get mailing lists. We surely don't all get mailing lists about the teams about which we are most enthused. So it seems to me r.s.baseball is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesn't necessarily follow day-to-day. This is not intended as flamage, but rather is an attempted answer, as you posed your post as a question.	9
But maybe his wife was :-) I don't claim to know whether it's true or not, but a couple different people (totally unrelated) have said Harry was 'relieved' of his duties because he had more than platonic relations with Augie Busch's wife. Judgement is left to the individual, cuz I sure don't claim to be an impeachable source in this case.	9
I am just wondering whether the official MLB stats includes Intentional Walks in the BB category or not?	9
so. done, career Velarde hasn't been to Columbus, if I recall, for about three years. Granted, he hasn't been a full time player but when he does play I've always thought he had a good bat. He might be demoralized about not playing full time, but he hasn't been shuttled around. I think he's been in New York ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989, or 90, I believe. I don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot it around either. I think if Velarde is given a chance, he could become extremely productive. I don't have any stats to back this up, and I don't know if his Defense would cost any games, but I think he could help - and he has this year. He has 3 HR already. Same goes for Jim Leyrtiz. He has a big mouth, but he does get the job done when he concentrates. I think the situation with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing. I think he might have realized something when the Marlins or Rockies didn't select him. The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now. Kamieniecki and Wickman/Militello in the bullpen? Ouch. I'm praying that the BP will return to last year's form....	9
Heheheheh.. Sorry, Roger, I wronged you.. You're not boring ALL the time.. This one is a classic. 'cordially, as always' HEHEHEHEHHE! Are you a jerk? Do people hate you? Are you no fun at parties? Well! Come to the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY! We can teach you to be 'cordial' with the best of them! Use such time honored 'cordiality' techniques as: 1) Calling people assholes! 2) Comparing them to viruses! For advanced students: 3) Comparing them to DIRTY viruses. What is a DIRTY virus, and how can you tell it from a clean one? We know, and here at the ROGER MAYNARD SCHOOL OF CORDIALITY, we can teach you to know, too! HEHEHEH.. Thanks, Roger.. This made my evening :-)	9
How about Brooks Robinson's last homerun ever? #268 came on 4-19-77 at Memorial Stadium with one out and two on in the bottom of the 10th inning. Larry Harlow was due up, but Brooks pinch-hit a 3-2 pitch from Dave LaRoche into the left field bleachers for a 6-5 win.	9
And not the only quality Mariner pitcher. I logged on expecting to see at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosio's NO HITTER, but nary a peep. So I'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games or even a hit in last night's gem. Not that we M's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers of New England's long-running tragedy, but only one winning season in history is something of a burden to bear. So we'll take our joys when we can get 'em. The Mariners now have two no-hit pitchers on the staff and not coincidentally those pitchers beat the Red Sox in back to back games. jsh	9
Well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but really, he only retired 26 batters in a row. The first out of the game was the front end of a double play. Still counts as a back-end perfect game in my book, though. Congrats to Chris Bosio. Too bad the Brewers couldn't hold on to him.	9
Can anyone mail me the address of Houston's Mailing List? Thanks in advance. J. Scott Smithers smithers@dcseq.uscga.edu	9
Fine, are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way? The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far; it's that he *will* hurt them, eventually. Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the past couple seasons. It has happened for the past 3+ seasons; where have you been? We'll see come September. (I have an outstanding bet with someone that Galarraga's OBP will be less than .300 on June 1.)	9
So THAT'S what happened to Denny McLain. Sad. For those of you who are interested, another baseball pariah, Pete Rose, has a weekday radio show on the Sports and Entertainment national radio network. I think it's 3-5 PM locally, 6-8 PM on the East coast. And actually, his on-air monologues about the baseball business sounds a lot more reasonable and articulate than what I hear from the Ray Knights of the world. -- Greg "Mockingbird" Franklin "Interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more f67709907@ccit.arizona.edu than mingling between G7 races." -- robohen	9
I know there's been a lot of talk about Jack Morris' horrible start, but what about Dennis Martinez. Last I checked he's 0-3 with 6+ ERA. Is the ageless wonder finally showing his age? Does he usually start off the season so slowly? I know he plans to start tonight. I hope he comes around.... I would appreciate any feedback concerning outlook on rest of Dennis Martinez's season... Thanks in advance,	9
discussing the fact that there were only 16 players who had ever hit 200 homeruns and stolen 200 bases in their career (while HoJo was batting). Anyone have a list? Not as easy as it sounds to come up with all of them. I couldn't. Mays, Mantle, Aaron, Henderson, Morgan, Bonds (Dad), ??? Frank Robinson? Molitor? Yount? Guessing now. I'd be interested to see the whole list.	9
Wiggins, Alan? But that's besides the point. I'm sure people would feel slightly sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed. But, they would also be criticizing him a lot more for his actions. Example? How about Jose Canseco? He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all of the sudden his attitude is awful. What the hell do speeding tickets have to do with clubhouse influence anyway? So why do sportswriters talk about it all the time. Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell? Both of whom had DWI problems towards the end of last year. (Two years ago?) It was cited as a sign of their immaturity, etc. Meanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't read any sportswriter complaining about that. They may have talked about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere criticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that matter) based on this incident.	9
I'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted. For most career K's with one team, if it's not Ryan, perhaps Steve Carlton. With the Rangers, Hough was there for a long time. In the 100 saves department...Maybe Lee Smith(he should have at least a hundred with the Cubbies, maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards.) Then maybe, Gossage?(NYY and SD), Fingers (MIL, OAK) Don't know about the homers/steals dept. In some other article,(Mets trivia), it could be Tim Leary in at least the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too. Probably Seaver and Koosman fit too. And in Randy Johnson's no-hitter, I think it was Scott Bradley, the other half of the old Mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate that night.	9
[Some discussion about whether Elias is money grubbing deleted] Some thoughts and facts, 1.) Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc. However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name. (The handbook, but not the scoreboard). To the best of my knowledge, the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook. 2.) The debate over Elias goes way back. Bill James' early stuff was hampered by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price. Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void. You can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course. Or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself. Having attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they just don't do that. In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the information available at all. 3.) That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too. I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than April. Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer. (Bias alert. I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)	9
Some comments deleted for bandwidth (God knows, we need it... :)) Ok, Roger, here's a question for you. Say you are running an expansion team. You don't HAVE a team at the moment, but the draft is coming up. Who are you going to pick, guys who have won the most WS rings, or guys who COULD contribute the most to your team. Say the Reds were dumb enough to not protect Larkin, and the Jays didn't protect Alfredo. Who would you pick? (I can't believe I'm getting involved in this... :) John	9
What's with John Franco? The Mets are hardly using him. I heard he was completely recovered, but now I'm not so sure. If there is anybody out there with information about Franco, I would appreciate it if you could drop me a line.	9

Let's be careful here. If players' performance was completely random in (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year. With two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year. We have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88). Just flipping a coin, you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. This is what we actually get-- No. of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip (random) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random. If there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin. Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good. In the four years ('84-'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years. Of those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two years. In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year. If it was just a random process, you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5). Everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein probably never had a "clutch" AB against a left-handed pitcher, but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage). This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually. A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the Elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin. (Self-serving plug follows: some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book, _The Perfect Game_, by Taylor Publishing. The authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug your local bookstores now, and maybe I can get enough to take my wife to dinner once.:-) Harold	9
No. I do not find this conceivable. I also cannot conceive of the possibility that there is any hypothetical team which Morris would help more than Clemens. Given your premise, yes. But you are alone in your ability to conceive of that premise.	9
: Hi there, : : I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now. : There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers. What does it say ?? ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game. Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA is 3.00. To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9. ERA = (ER/IP) * 9 An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error. More specifically, if an error occurs that represented the third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs. Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game. Here are some examples: If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. If an error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after this error and NOT counted as earned runs. If a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game before the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who were left on base. If the those runners who were left on base score, and the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game. I hope this explains things for you.	9
Take a look at the standings. It's REAL easy to get so focussed on minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place. If it's working, you don't SCREW IT UP by changing things, just because you think it ought to be different. Some folks like to argue about theoretical details. I prefer to watch teams win. When the Giants slip to third, then we can talk about how to re-arrange the batting order. Until then, I think it's stupid to focus on what's wrong, for the simple fact that IT'S WORKING AS IT IS. In the majors? I don't follow AL, so I won't comment on "Majors". In the NL, if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team, it'd be Clark, and I'd hit him third. (My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it, because I've never been able to GET Clark. I'd take any of the three without hesitation in real life, but I think Clark is it). Williams: Not even close. I much prefer his defense, but when he isn't headcasing it, Matt has a good, solid swing and some real punch. If he drops to .230, then he wanders out of cleanup, but according to the latest Baseball Weekly, he's hitting .275, and in the last week, hitting .296. That's not exactly chopped liver. Mostly, though, the Giants are winning, and frankly, as long as that continues, it's rather silly to second-guess their strategy. But evidently, some folks would rather be right than be first.	9
THe bowler is John Burkett, who went to 4-0 last night. He is a bargain pickup on my roto team, I got him at a minimum of $5. This is not really true. Excluding last season, the Giants has been a better 2nd half team. In 1991, they had a hot August to pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before fading in September. The Giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last season for two reasons: (1) Barry Bonds (2) Roger Craig is no longer the manager. Dusty can manage his pitching staffs much better than Craig.	9
Can someone in this net post a Yankee Schedule? I need this right away.	9
Was it just me, or did it look like Hirschbeck pointed to the 3B umpire before calling that strike? I thought that's why Gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire; he thought Hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong umpire. After Hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown, Cox came onto the field. It was obvious that he was trying to get time called before the pitch, but no one was watching. Your listing pretty much agreed with what I saw, with the aforementioned addendums. Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark. Personally, I was amazed that Gant didn't get ejected. But that's why Cox did; it's called protecting your players. And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game, all I can say is that you'd be making baseball history. Even in the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field. And I'd have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the Braves did Fri. night. Anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring outrageous postings. I will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving Hirschbeck. I think there will be some with other teams as well. I hope not.	9
TRIVIA TIME!!! OK, We all know that Dave "My Batting Average is Down in the" Valle caught Chris Bosio's no hitter last night (and is batting over .300, BTW). Here is the question: Who caught Randy Johnson's no-hitter in June of 1990. (Hint: Not Dave Valle :-))	9
Bill James is, however, very closely tied to STATS.	9
Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction. They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August. However, I would take back a few moves: 1. The Jim Abbott Trade. I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a great pitcher also. He could win the Cy Young this year, but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield isn't good enough. So why was this not a good trade? JT Snow. How many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the Angels? I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player. The Yanks should have kept him. What about Mattingly, you ask? Well - it's great that the Yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as before his back injury. It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take Snow over Mattingly at first. The Yanks also gave up two promising propects with Snow for Abbott. Besides, with Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects. I know Abbotts only 26, but this was too much to give up. I believe George forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that Abbott will be a big hit in NY. However, I'd like to see the Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show. 2. Wade Boggs. I live in Boston and like Wade a lot. But, his career is winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?). Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range. What a shame about Charlie Hayes, huh? 3. Spike Owen. See Wade Boggs. I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri or whoever. Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point. And these guys are on the down sides of their careers. 4. Danny Tartabull. Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. But he never is. We should expect 120 games max out of him. Meanwhile, Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing left field! I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder. What I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year. They should (at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two. I'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner. Certainly, the Boggs deal was all George. It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now. The veterans are always available and can be added at any time (like Boston did this year). Develop the young players first, then add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep them). Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect. I'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for example). George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away. Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future. Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it's baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time!	9

Someone on the minor league mailing list probably does. I do, but I don't have time to type the whole thing in (I don't mind looking up specific date ranges or individual games when I can, but there are limits). Besides, this stuff is EASY to find. Baseball America puts out a book called the Directory. It's $10(US). Has every team's data and schedule in it. If I WERE to type in the whole scheudle, I'd just be spending a lot of time infringing on their copyright. Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list (see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should chec out the BA Directory.

<KIME.93Apr20133127@mongoose.torolab.ibm.com> <mjones.735335684@fenway> Organization: Eskimo North (206) 367-3837 {eskimo.com} Yeah, Morris just knows how to win. That's why he lost 18 for Detroit in 1990. Funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. And if "rings" was the only criteria for success, then teams would always tend to repeat, and eventually you'd have the same team win the WS every bleepin' year. Sort of like the yanks in the 50s. Morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good, not great, career. Toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year, with Morris and all those rings, because their pitching staff was destroyed over the off-season.	9
If it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead, it would probably also result ina greater number of pickoffs. I think it would be a workable rule, but it would probably be best to experiment in another league before trying it in the bigs.	9

At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either. I was more than a little worried about Viola's elbow. But you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola instead. Now I'm even happier. Viola seems to have rebounded nicely. How long did Viola sign for. Three years? I generally agree with their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers. But I think they enforce it rather too strictly. These days the premier pitchers all sign three or four year deals. Which leaves the Jays with Morris and Stewart. If the Jays want to compete for top free agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks. Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris? Are there any automatic activation clauses? What is the buyout amount?f	9
As of today's USA Today (4/23) John Wetteland should come off of the DL tonight and possibly pitch in the series this weekend (I forget who they play.) Derek Lilliquist is probably going to be the main closer, but it will be kind of a bullpen by committee also.	9
Er..yes. If Manny Lee was on your team last year, your team would have been the Toronto Blue Jays. Again. If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would not have been the Albuquerque Leftturns. It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays. That's the whole point isn't it? Clemens didn't get a ring but Morris did. Exactly. And Morris was part of the team. Would the Jays have won with Clemens? We will never know. But we do know that the Jays won with Morris. So how could you possibly say that Clemens had a better year? No pitcher in baseball could have had a better year than Morris had last year. --	9

Umpires are not required to call time out just because a player asks for time. Only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's or hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time. The batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive a pitch. I'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and the minute for warm-ups. But I think umpires should tell hitters to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and instruct the pitcher to pitch. The same goes for pitchers. Umps should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball will be called. That's the way it should be. Ryan Robbins Penobscot Hall University of Maine	9
Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often). This sense creates drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's attention. In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about (here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time? And they're just playing a sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/ touch-self-in-interesting-locations. There's a lot of "dead time" with the players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans will appreciate that one). To the non baseball junkie this is boring. At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie. That's what Major League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of shortening the game. It's because of T.V. not because "football has more action than baseball".	9
Is there a Chicago Cubs mailing list?? If so, I'd like to join. Any help appreciated....	9
I sent a version of this post out a while ago, but it was swallowed by the void. My apologies if anyone ends up receiving it. Oh no, I wasn't confused -- I understood that it was your personal opinion. But I thought we were discussing the need to shorten games. The arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage them from going to the ballpark. I'd like to see if the increased length of games has negatively affected attendance. If it has, then there *is* a problem, and something should be done about it. If it hasn't, then there *isn't* a problem, and there's no need to monkey with things as they are.	9

Alright, that's enough. I've suffered with all kinds of insults (as typical for the net), but give me a break. Galarraga is currently batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he isn't drawing enough walks. What would he have to do to please you guys, bat 1.000? You can hardly claim that he is "hurting his team". If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen), *THEN* I would agree with you that he isn't taking enough pitches. My comment that "he isn't paid to walk" doesn't mean that he should have a license to swing at bad pitches and make outs; it's more along the lines of: he's batting .400 and leading the league in RBI's so what bloody difference does it make if he isn't drawing a lot of walks? Sheesh.	9
Good question. It's my impression, not backed by evidence, that general south-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect I was talking about. Back in the 20's there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers; they were rejected by the commissioner and others. Well, what *did* I mean to say? Aside from some short-lived exceptions such as Japanese internment in WW II, only blacks were affected by laws regarding: slavery, Jim Crow, miscegenation, military service, etc. If my claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come up with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.

I remember a post from last year indicating that a "pitch clock" was tried in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work. I don't remember why they said that it did not work. Anyone remember this? Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was inevitable. How would a pitch clock work on throws to first? Another pair of suggestions: 1. Remove the Balk rule. It is the runners responsibility to stay "safe" no matter what the pitcher does. 2. If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time (X = 3 to 5) without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base as if walked. The no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage. The base-walk allows the runner to "challenge" pitcher to throw over to the base. I too, find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his "jewlery".	9
A "reasonable" umpire would have recognized that Ron Gant was disturbed with the call. A "reasonable" umpire would have realized that there was a 1-run game in progress, with two outs in the ninth. What Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure. What a "normal" baseball player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument with the umpire, and since you can't argue balls and strikes, he would have been ejected from the game. Ron Gant, by trying to avoid such a conflict, was penalized for showing some restraint. Incidentally, a "reasonable" home plate umpire would not have been so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire, as Gant requested. If the home plate umpire had appealed to first, the first base umpire could have wrung up the strike, and Gant would not have been so upset. If the call had been a ball, and the catcher had requested the appeal, it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help. Finally, the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so-called efforts to "speed up the game." The game was played very quickly, it was just at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth, and the only delays in the entire game had been *the result* of actions by the umpires (other than Deion having to clean garbage off the field).	9

I've only ever seen this called once. Back around 1979-1980. I think that Steve Carlton was pitching. On the other hand, I am not sure how much effect this would have. It seems that most of the time lost is when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this. I have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the game. Let's be serious. The relief pitcher has normally been throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes. Does he really need 8 more pitches?	9

Be patient. He has a sore shoulder from crashing into the wall. The Cards will give him all the time he needs to come around. He is their full time centerfielder. He will not however steal as often this year as he is hitting clean-up.	9
First, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball. The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches. And while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this is only true when they don't become extra-long. Quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better. Bring back the two-hour baseball game! (And the three and a half hour golf game with it!)	9

Since Cox was the only Brave rung up, I suspect I would have thrown him out too. You simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did. It is disrespectful of not only the home plate umpire, but of the dignity of the game.	9
During the local Rockies broadcast the other day Don Baylor went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up on the screen that it was the "so and so sponsored" pitching change. I saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored. At other times during the game Rockies announcer Duane Kuiper was setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation that Charlie Jones would jump in and discuss the situation. But what does Charlie do, he read's a beer advertisement and leaves Duane hanging. Duane's strategy proved prophetic. These examples happen over and over on radio and T.V. braodcasts making them sometimes very boring to listen to. I guess it's just a matter of time before a player sells his name to Budweiser, Nike, etc. I don't think it will be long until we hear: "Nike Budweiser drills it deep to left field, Chevrolet goes back, back, it's gone!

Hey, Bosio threw a no-no what the hell a Red Sox fan going to say to that. Heck...Remeber Matt Young last year? ICK..	9
^^^^ ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^ Whoa. Aren't you forgetting a couple of guys named Gant and Justice? He can lead off. He'll probably steal 40. He might hit .300. He'll never hit 20+ homers. I think you went 2 for 4 on this one. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ You said it all right there. Does anyone else out there not like Deon? I think he's all hype. His .300 season last year was good, but I'm not convinced that he can do it again. It reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987(?) when Tim Wallach hit 30 or so homers and had 127 RBI. It never even came close to happening again. Of course, maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business and don't play it up for the attention. Just my HO. Doug Roberts - Larry Walker is God. Delino Deshields thinks he is.	9
I didn't say that. Did you say that? Wow, I can't believe that anyone would think that the Braves (or any other team, for that matter) should get the title for free. What a dolt that person would be, if that was what they thought. Incredible. --	9
I'm sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by rookie J.T. Snow of the California Angeles. Other than the fact that his father was a star receiver with the L.A. Rams and is now a radio personality in Los Angeles and J.T. came from the Yankees organization I don't know much about J.T. If anyone has info and background on the young fenom....please post. By the way, for those of you not following his exploits he has hit four home runs in three days. Two last night. He has also delivered the winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season. Thanks...	9
This is certainly not the case. There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit. The "clutch pitching" quoted above is something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher. Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points, standard deviation about 30). There will be such hitters in any league, just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays. And there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year, probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability. *Based only on this data*, I don't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past. But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit. Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage? (Any portion of Sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.) Do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run? Do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?	9

There are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to state something as fact. Baseball is not one of them. Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last year, and Larkin was better than Griffin. No, I can't ascertain this. I can't prove it. But I'm not required to do so. And since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless, why don't you simply stay out of them?	9
I stopped going to A's games some years ago while I still lived inthe Bay Area for exactly this reason. I believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan. They encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate, to throw to first often, to study the catchers' signals, and so on. And almost every A's hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch. This is not, imo, a coincidence. This is planned. And I hate it. As for the Gant situation, I did not see the game or the replays. But I do wonder. What if Gant had requested a time out? Would Hirschbeck have been required to give it to him? Could he have denied the requst? For all he (the ump) knew, Gant could have had dirt in his eye.	9
How about Matt Nokes 2 run single against Ron Darling. Was that a hit or what? While watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding The Boss' talking about Mark Connor as bullpen coach. He said something like it's Mark Connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!! Here we go again!! George sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business. Shut up George, just spend the money, get the players and leave Buck and the coaches and players alone.	9
The subject line says it all. What is the rule that qualifies a pitcher as making a save?	9
I DID NOT WRITE THAT! In fact, those statements were a rebuttal to an earlier posting that I made, and this was culled from my *strong* rebuttal to those statements. PLEASE! Slander. Shame. "after the game, it's no big deal" ???? After the employees leave the workplace, it doesn't matter what they say about the boss or the company? Puhlease. First, it's Ross Porter. Second, I am really tired of seeing the kind of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media person says or writes. I have a brain. If I choose to characterize something in a certain fashion, it's because that is what I believe to be accurate. It is not just because some unnamed "mediot" made the characterization. I did *not* brand Darryl's response as petulant, because I never heard any response from Darryl. I did call him a name. I referred to him as a primadonna. Someone else concluded that I did that because I "hate" him. I don't hate him. I think he's a primadonna. If you disagree, fine. But stop putting words in my mouth. -- The Beastmaster	9
I agree with Nick. What's the big deal about long games? If you want to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch. And yes, baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when it's coming from TV people, has to something to do with advertising. Probably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could otherwise be sold as advertising time.	9
Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen. The lefties, Stanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch. The bullpen is fine, probably superior. Also false. Gant, Nixon, Justice, Hunter, Blauser present a decent enough offense. EVERYONE is slumping (except Blauser), not just Pendleton. BTW, what is the story with Brian Hunter? Is he in the dog house?	9
If you had free reign to design your own instrument cluster, which gauges would you choose to have beyond the basic set? I consider the basic set to be: - tach - coolant temp (or cylinder head temp for air-cooled engines) - oil pressure - amps - speedo - fuel others that are nice to have: - volts (maybe this should be in the basic set) - vacuum/boost I can think of a few others, but what are your ideas and why?	7
When do the new M.benz "C" class cars come out? The new nomenclature that MB has adopted will it only apply to the "c" class cars or will it also apply to the current "s" class cars. Does any one know what will replace the current 300 class since the "c" class will be smaller and more in line with the current 190. Another question, Is BMW realising a new body style on the current 7 series and 5 series. They seem to be a bit dated to me.	7
Turbo boost is necessary if a turboed car. Fuel reserve warning. Coolant level warning. It would also be nice to have a gauge that would cycle across the different sensors in the FI system such as O2 sensor, altitude, Air Flow... I'd love to get Tranny and diff. Brake temp would be great... And a BIG ASS tach. :) Sean	7
If I'm going to drive on a public road then I need a speedometer, and an odometer helps for navigation. My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum: Engine-temp and Oil-press warning lights and a fuel gauge. My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter and oil-temp gauges. If I had a turbo car, I'd want a vacuum manifold/boost gauge. An oil pressure gauge is a nice, reassuring gauge to look at. If my car was air cooled, then I would substitute a cyl-head-temp gauge for the water-temp gauge. A few years ago, I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb. The gauge layout, from left to right, top to bottom was: ---------------------------------- speedometer ---------------------------------- fuel tranny press temp ---------------------------------- differential water temp temp ---------------------------------- big orange tach oil-press warning light ---------------------------------- oil-temp boost ---------------------------------- oil-press ----------------------------------	7

best way to reduce risk when operating a vehicle is being able to avoid hazards and, for that reason my preferred vehicle is a motorcycle. When I do use a four wheeler my primary reasons are: it will keep me dry, it will keep me warm, or it will carry more cargo. If the four wheeler has as much collision protection as the average motorcycle, then it has enough form me. How do you define safe? One definition of safe is without risk. Is -- Chas DoD #7769	7

Yup. Radar detectors that detect Ka band will pick up photo radar as it's reflected from some poor slob ahead of you that just got nailed. BTW, many photo radar installations in the southern U.S. became targets for high-powered rifles, or had their lenses "decorated" with cow flop, etc. Not that I'm advocating destruction of public property, but you get the picture....

I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem. Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight fluid. Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight. Some of the cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving conditions. I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and had to replace the transmission bearings!). My older cars used 85 weight oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).	7
You guys are correct. The Bricklin was produced in Canada. The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display. Most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they have it. If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73 Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.	7
I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using Geico. Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want to make radar detectors illegal. They also ask if you have a detector (probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you). I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that was not their fault.	7
Seems to me that I heard that some early Saabs were 2 cycle V4's. Then again, who could possibly care ?>	7

Tony, I believe, first of all, that Max's car is an Austrailian built car. I don't think its a chopped up U.S. unit. It may be called a Kangaroo or Roo or something similar-not sure. But, I do recall reading that Austrailian cars used Ford V-8 engines. The Ford V-8 Interceptor is, I think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor. Whatever the case that small car with a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for miles/kilometers. I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject.	7
Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v. This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon. Very rare also.

Rich, First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq .com) during your search/acquisition of the 67. $20k sounds about right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car. This means that the car may not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver and or hobby car. You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette Black Book immediately. Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it. Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a few hours in reading the "Corvette Buyer's Guide" and purchase Noland Adams' tape "How to Buy a Corvette." The tape shows you how to check for damage, etc.. There are many many factors that will affect the value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67. The list is much too long to go into here. Join the VetteNet where there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage vettes) that are available to help you. The pubs I mentioned above are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several other Corvette parts sources. Good luck!!!	7

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model. My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as some other cars. Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes. I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus. In general, comfort and performance were both significant. Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below. Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like: tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof) Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower "would you buy that car again" and safety ratings in Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a + for some) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626, and in our minds, not significantly better. We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the "big 3", due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products, (b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts and no air bag.	7
VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps. Also, VW uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the mechanics of it. Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway. It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even further ahead of gas engines in emissions.	7

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post :). Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e-mail or post! 1. When making turns, especially when accelerating, there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of of the car. Sounds like it could be the differential. What could cause this? Is the differential going bad? I recently had the differential fluid changed, and it DID have tiny metal bits in it. (And no, the sound is NOT something rolling around in the trunk!) 2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from the exhaust for 5-10 seconds. Exhaust valves going bad? Worn rings? Anyone know whether the valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped? 3. Brakes. More pedal travel than I feel comfortable with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is relatively clear. Pedal does NOT slowly sink to the floor when held down. Pedal does not feel spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes might help -- could anything else cause this? 4. Tranny. Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from 3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd. Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put through all the gears and then back to park, as per Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark. 5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have 4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps in turns at moderate to high speed. How hard are they to change? Can they be reconditioned? I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners out there with stories to tell and/or advice. Here in Philly, these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted into taxis. Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be junked. About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and Impalas (& Broughams).	7
Many cars sold here in Finland are *small* and *cheap* cars (at least when compared to other cars --- note that we have over 120 % car tax). And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a 1.3 L engine?	7

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm Bricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian. He was the first one to import Subarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe. Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features. The Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car. If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to design "experimental" safety cars, you will recognize the general appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc. Anyone recall other safety features? The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right. Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad. The choice of colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible, I suppose. The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no motor at all.

Hello everyone, I have an insurance question. Allstate insurance SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of exceeding repair costs. Person says "WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!" and takes it to another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the dealer. One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred in Pennsyvania. QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled? Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of thing. chris@camp.wpic.pitt.edu	7

I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national defense plan etc. The requirements were to move heavy army trucks at 70mph. Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph on the same 3 to 4 lane road. Around Washington DC they can't keep traffic flowing at 55.	7
Ford aimed for 75% US content when they designed the new Probe. In actual practice it came out to 77% US content. If my '89 is any example the 23% that is imported may be the engine and brakes, at least the '89 had Missybitchy brakes.	7
Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature Coolant Temperature Manifold Vacuum Ammeter, Voltmeter Fuel Pressure [maybe] (Problematic, since you either need an electronic sensor/gauge pair or you have to mount the damn thing outside the car) In addition, it'd be nice to have a big red idiot light 'Check Guages' connected to Oil pressure, Oil Temp, Coolant Temp, Ammeter & Voltmeter. With heaps of guages, it's hard to look at them all all the time. In the case of oil pressure, for example, you want to know right away if your oil pump goes bad, unlike coolant temperature, a minute or two of 0 oil pressure would be A Very Bad Thing(tm). Adam	7

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Agreed! I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and the AT. In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance. BTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some funny noises from the AT, I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything unusual. -Chris Christopher J. Born	7

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes. Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals. It is a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you shouldn't have to pay them to fix it. In my case, they fixed it on my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts). Having removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate was fair.	7

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det ector available. The point here is trust and reliability. I've been able to "tr ust" the Valentine more than any other detector I've owend. If the Valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal. That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i t works okay. Although, I must admit that I haven't really noticed the reflection problem of one radar souce.	7
Same engine, different state of tune (less hp and maybe more torque). My friend at work regularly takes 6 people in his and it seems to haul around just fine.	7

I want to thank all the people that responded to my post a few weeks ago about buying an '86 Chev Nova with over 100,000 mi. I decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month. I replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil. So far no problems have surfaced. I received many suggestions and encouragement on this purchase and figured a late "thank you" was better than none. Thanks to all!	7
I am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles. I have heard of the LE SE LSE SSE SSEI. Could someone tell me the differences are far as features or performance. I am also curious to know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how much are they in demand this time of year. I have heard that the mid-spring early summer is the best time to buy.	7

I bought a set of ARE's a few months back and decided to add locks so that I could keep my new rims.

Germans are just more organised; you can't blitz all of Europe in a matter of , what, 9 months, unless you're pretty organised.

Low oil pressure, usually. Could be your oil pump, or... checked your oil lately??? MC	7
Actually, that'd be 155 mph and 60 mph (the legal speed limit for trucks) in *two* lanes, each direction. It's a hell of a rush when those trucks fly by. (or was that me flying by them? Who cares, the rush is really something else, and so is the draft)	7
No comparison. The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector. No directional indicators, no Bogey counter, no radar signature analysis, no remote display option, not as sensitive, not as well built. Had it, sent it back!	7
: : I am considering buying a 1993 Chevy or GMC 4x4 full-size pickup with : the extended cab. Any opinions about these vehicles? Have there been : any significant problems? : : -- : Dick Grady Salem, NH, USA grady@world.std.com : So many newsgroups, so little time! I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May. It has had many, many problems. See my earler post that describes the situation. I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me. If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear. They have put three of them in my truck so far. After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly. There is no way to fix them. Chevrolet says that the noise is "a characteristic of the transmission." Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck. On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line). If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed. I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones. They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for "engine longevity" reasons. So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off). Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included. What really bothered me was the way they reacted. They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time. So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic. I will never buy another Chevrolet.	7

A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for $5500 Cdn. The reason the car is selling for so little is that is has 155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.). The car's owner claims the car is in good condition. My question is: how reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high? Would it be worthwhile for me to buy the car? Any problem areas that I should look out for? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Post responses and/or e-mail me. Thanks Steve Hui	7
Hahahahahaha. *gasp* *pant* Hm, I'm not sure whether the above was just a silly remark or a serious remark. But in case there are some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data file on Korea since...mid 1970s. Owning a car in Korea is no longer a luxury. Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do have at least one car. The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park. Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan. Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only car manufacturer in Korea. Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I believe Kia is back in business as well. Imported cars, such as Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still quite expensive. Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics and bureaucracy. He's quite uninformed.	7
I think the Blue Book is the NADA handbook for used car prices, no? Is the Blue Book value given the retail or wholesale value??? The Blue Book value isn't set in stone, though. Low milage, extra addons and stuff like that there can increase the resale price of the car, you may want to head on over to the local library or borrow your friends Blue Book and read up on that sort of stuff. I paid ~$400 under BB (retail) for my '87 Civic in 1990, and it was in perfect condition and had only ~14.5K miles on it. The guy was desparate to sell, new kid on the way, etc., but it was a good price. Remeber, both you and the buyer, if he has any sort of brains at all, are using the Blue Book, so you should pick a fair price. Chintan Amin llama@uiuc.edu	7

First off, the correct spelling of Nissan's luxury automobile division is "Infiniti" not "Infinity." I would also like to clear up the question of what kind of engines power Lexus and Infiniti automobiles, since a person had remarked in earlier posts that most Lexus and Infiniti models had V6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each manufacturer used V8 engines. Lexus: LS400- V8 GS300- V6 ES300- V6 SC400- V8 SC300- V6 Infiniti: Q45- V8 J30- V6 G20- inline 4 (I must admit that I cannot remeber for sure here) I hope this helps.	7
Drivel. I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP. I only have about 370 miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put together. By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 cars. Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a shortage. GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next year (according to a WSJ article). Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in Popular Mechanics. I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 1993 issue (p30). Direct side on view. Although they described it as a "seriously handsome car with broad shoulders," I thought it looked pretty boring in that view. Roofline reminded me of a Toyota Celica (yuch!). Description of mechanicals same as has been reported from the PM article.	7
R. Goldstein (rdg@world.std.com) sez: : As the subject says, I am moving from Mass. to Calif. and will be driving : mostly on Interstate 80. : Any advice from folks who have done it before? - Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon "only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner" surcharge. - Prepare your car. Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters. If you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff just in case of a flat. In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to the tire. - If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft. - McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms. - invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna. It may help if you're stranded, and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc. - Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a new state, to catch all the speeders who have "escaped" the previous state. - Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of 65mph rural interstate -=$>Dave<$=-	7
It isn't that bad. At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared to the slab sides on the Consulier. And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12 (thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together). Also Ettore Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the development. So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in today's world. Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to take over part of Ferrari as well... That's funny. I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. :-) Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s (from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and the present VFR-750F). It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.	7
My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially restored. The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual mileage. The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses. He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine. The body and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires, front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts. The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by a wind-blown car cover. It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks. Questions: Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out? The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way of braking action? It seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop. What should we expect it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine? The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps. The weather was cold. Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever shrunk? Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed? Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price? Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry. While my brother once owned an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars. Any help with these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated.	7
Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should have this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes steam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have better luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake lines.	7
i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a little loud, those with 2.2 MR2's i can't imagine any unbiased person paying it any compliments. sounded like my ex-dormmate's rusty chevy chevette. with the 1.6 i would want to redline it just for the music, with the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up.. the new camry 2.2 features balance shafts. i guess since the mr2 is getting the axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this.. it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is "only" 2 liters.. the engineers had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses. also, in europe the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also "only" 2 liters.. as usual, the undiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good) gets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans did not.	7
who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names? if the cars were named after a person, e.g. honda, i'd be more respectful. wrong! the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes, while the ES300 uses a V6. only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline 6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.	7

I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions. The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles. ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car. I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem licked. Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months later! This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem. I didn't find any. Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system. I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem. I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch. My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal, the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it. What do you think of that as an explanation? Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in? Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort. What can you suggest here? Many thanks. Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...	7
I just saw a picture of the '94 Mustang in Popular Mechanics - what a disappointment after being bombarded with pictures of the Mach III...	7
If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but "re- skinning" the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications. And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job of it. The "new" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.	7
Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels. The main reason they are considered "cleaner" is because they are better at the emissions we actually measure and regulate. But they also contribute additional emissions which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or limits have been defined. Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction. Diesel particulates are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity. And alcohols emit signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline. The evidence is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives. And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe. There the stench of the diesels is awful and it can even burn the eyes. Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.	7

'63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker) rear 'axle' housing. All these years used same brakes, similar springs etc Late 70's was a bad year for GM reliability. Catastrophic converter was added in 1975. Cheapest corvette '78 to '79 low end about 4k tops out about $12k except for those morooons that think there '78 indy / 25th aniversity vette is special. These guys have been known to ask 25K. I don't think they get it . Best buy: convertables 69 - 74. I got my 69 for 5K - needs body work but I'm willing. Parts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc. V-8 reliability / looks / independant suspension / 4 wheel disk and all under 10K. And they thought a miata was a good deal. My origional inquires to my insurance agent: I can drive my '69 convertable for 3000 miles or less per year, I must keep it in a locked garage and it will cost me 2% of the stated value per year (does this sound right?). Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look for origional equipe. Depending on what mods have been done the car could be worth only 10K. Problems like wrong engine / trans. Wrong paint type ( vetts used lacquer) An modification would reduce tthe value. But your looking for a car to drive right? This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual / no air car. A 427 would put it closer to $30K.	7
In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised, of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot. Also, most Canadians are too stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two feet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_ operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it can't be done). Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift for you for no addition money.	7

"traction control" as far as the optional feature that one buys with cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential. a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's are torque sensing. viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing. for that matter, so are "traction control" systems that use ABS sensors and pulse braking. then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not familiar with the workings.	7
From article <1r1i7mINN4n4@cronkite.cisco.com>, by kmac@cisco.com (Karl Elvis MacRae): I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the highest cost of all the ones you mentioned. I have good friends who have all three of the trucks you talked about, the ones with kids all went to the ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk you need. The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan. Every one has been happy with what they bought. Although no one is into serious four wheel off road driving.	7
Shaz, Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way: There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators. initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car. The computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off. After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again. So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off. I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator. It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil. Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed. PS. my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW"	7
Enough, already. Let's take this discussion to some other newsgroup that's more appropriate. Most of us are tired of it and would like to get back to old cars, IMHO.	7
-> The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years. A version -> of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then. How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and 351 Fords and 305 and 350 Chevys can be built up. Still, it will provide a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new Firebird/Camaros. It wouldn't surprise me if Ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the Mustang. (We all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway) -> Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new -> Camaro/Firebird, IMO. I must agree. I don't think I've seen anything as impressive looking as the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 Formula 400 Firebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me. The bastard.)	7
1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner! Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt & dust. Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise ready to run. Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent. The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop. It is priced at $12,000. 1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's. Needs engine work, but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500. 1952 MG-TD Basket Case. I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good for that. Everything seems to be there except the tach. Would make a good project car or parts car if you insist. No apparent rust but the upholstery is a disaster. Stored inside since the '70's. The top was new but now soso. This one has wire wheels! Looking for $4,500. All three cars will be sold "as they stand" with no hassles or haggles. Time has passed by and it is time to part company. Prices are negotiable.

: But waiiiiiit, isn't Nissan officially registering the car as far as : government paperwork goes, Nissan Stanza Altima, to avoid costly and : lengthy paperwork? I read this on the net a while ago, and someone : actually may have said there's a little Stanza logo on the Altima : somewhere. I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a little Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk. The Altima is emblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted to the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up close to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous. In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima. Anybody know *why* Nissan did it this way?	7
Because some people like them (and some people actually need them). Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics! Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-) Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve "fun." :-) I personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe, with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side my '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390 with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the morning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO. James	7
A Yugo that will go 1/4mi in 7.7 seconds will _not_ lose on the street. That's just too damn quick. It might be wrapped around a telephone pole at the end of that quarter mile, but it will be there alone... Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_ MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than the sticker price of either. Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too. Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too. Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the "pony car" class came from) with a performance model. That's why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet accessible--with room for performance tweaking. The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche, and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least, does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro. James	7
I've heard *unconfirmed* rumours that there is a new Integra being released for '94. Does anybody have any info on this? The local sales people know as much as I can throw them. --Parms.	7
I'm not sure if this made it out so i'll try again. I have an Ecklar's (sp?) Corvette car cover for sale. The cover is canvas on the outside and felt on the inside. It is weather proof and in great condition. I'm asking $95.00 and I'll pay shipping. (originally $175.00 in October of 1992).	7
As I recall from reading posts here a while back, Rovax (Rovacs?) died because it was larger and noisier than the competing cheap R12 systems of it day. Probably a case of bad timing. I think the system would have a better chance today now that R12 systems are on death row, but investors may be hard to come by a second time.	7

For the information of those not "lucky" enough to live in the city of Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks, it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated. This is an ordinance unique (I think) to the city of Austin. Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here. Recovered freon is not required to be "purchased" from the car it is withdrawn from. As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it is reintroduced to the system. Just another quality service from an _Enviornmentally Conscious_ city.	7
I looked at that Bimmer yesterday. It's an '81, has about 90kmi, according to owner (odometer stopped working at 68Kmi). Drivess well, sounds good, body is OK, he wants $3000. i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary driver on this one, and she wants auto. The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!) The A/C seems to have a leak. The sunroof is sticky, but operational. Odometer does not work, as mentioned before. Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm. Wipers are slow. That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, rotors and calipers, exhaust. The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that, although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it. So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust. I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers what issue? Mike.S	7
I would also be interested in finding out about the '94 Talon, and I suspect that many other people would be interested too, so let's get some responses on the net. The question again: Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi Eclipse / Plymouth Laser? I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant, and that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been released. So anyway, any info on the '94 Talon would be appreciated.	7

Hey all, I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance coverage. This also applies to my existing car insurance policy. Does anyone understand what the "Limited Tort Option" means. Will it lower my rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt to have it? What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)? Is it a good deal or should I ignore it? I'm not the type to sue anyone at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to the insurance company as a vandalism claim. Please help. Thanks in advance.	7
It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect. Upon being heated, the gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be condensed. This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle. The only problem is that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6). Max	7

Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm, let's go on the assumption that one is desired. The question then remains, which one? I've owned a Hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get another for my new car. The Alpine has been highly recommended, but what about Clifford and VSE's Derringer 2? Any others? I want all of the standard stuff; door lock interface, starter kill, light flash, LED, valet mode, passive/active, shock/motion sensor, etc... Thanks for the advice!	7
On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either. Cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car. So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd. To calculate drag use this formula: D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2). Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). Note that power is: P = F * v Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s). Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term. That's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed. Ditto for decreases in Cd. So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is: (sound of trumpet fanfare) 101 mph Sorry to dissappoint.	7
I think you mean ARPA; AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons, and I seriously doubt that they'd want young whippersnappers building anything on their backbones, what with de-calcification and all :-) The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it, it's a US site. That includes: .com commercial .edu educational .mil US Military sites .gov US Gov't non-military sites (eg NASA sites) .org anyone who is "none of the above" There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today). US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default to US sites if there's no country code. I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this (or wants to know more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out the book _The_Whole_Internet_User's_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol. (or is it Catalog and User's Guide? I can never remember, and my copy is my desk at home...). It's a very good not-necessarily-technical guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including USENET). I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series, but it is published by O'Reilly and Associates. This should go to one of the news.* newsgroups, but damned if I can figure out which one.... :-) James	7
The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front. They still run a straight axle, but with coils. The 4Runner is the one with independent front. The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system. The 91-up Cruiser does have full time 4WD, but the center diff locks in low range. My brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which has done all the 4+ trails in Moab without a tow. The 93 and later is even better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.	7
Stay away from GEICO. A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit enforcement. The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the limit" you were. If I remember correctly, at "more than 20 over", you'll get something like a 65% increase. If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped immediately. One accident claim and you will be dropped. After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim. He was dropped immediately. Since then he has been with State Farm for years with no complaints. I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.	7

Mail bounced, so... Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle. Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing. I assume this is _retail_ bluebook. There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale. You really want the retail price if you can get it. The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car. You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area. For example, blue book prices are low for California. A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices. It might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price). I don't know what you mean by "an acquaintance" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery. There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should. Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere. Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook. That's probably a safer approach than selling to a private party. --	7

I have a few questions about the TAX on a used car purchase. I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car. I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car. But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or on the purchase price. Also, what tax rate is used ? The owner lives in Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax. Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ? (the difference is a whole $50) One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ? Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and register a used car ? (I've never done this before.)	7

Primarily milage. Gas is much more expensive, so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer. This, along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with smaller engines. These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh well with an automatic. So, having engines that don't work well with autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a manual. (Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals. If you've got the money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to drive through the slushbox.) As automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably reduced. Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel. So there aren't compelling reasons to go automatic. -dB	7

just out of curiosity, how is this "dog clutch" any different from a synchro transmission. What you described SOUNDS the same to me. In fact, what little i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs" and said they were synonymous. The gears are always meshed in a synchronized gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least, that is what i was taught. Explain, por favour?	7

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every 4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June. Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation in Europe. Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe or Japan first and extrapolate from there. C+D reported that the engine would be a carryover I think.	7
Talk to Philip Greenspun. He took Ford to court recently and, despite much manouvering and trickery on Ford's part, he won!

From article <1993Apr21.190251.14371@sequent.com>, by troy@sequent.com (Troy Wecker): . . . . . . It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the Valentine-1. I'd like to give some feedback based on real life experince. I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree. The only time it does is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different directions. I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area. I have found the directional indication to be very useful. In one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other. As I passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed. Then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction. With other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection. But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there was another trap. And there was! On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm. For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator changes. The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place. When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source. With other detectors, I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none. I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks. -Barry	7
Hello all, I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a "good" brand if one exists.

You guys are correct. The Bricklin was produced in Canada. The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa has one, and sometimes they put it on display. Most of the time, it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room. It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they have it.

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car. Before I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check "net.wisdom" on the subject. :) It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting "stuck" in 3rd gear. As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls. Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to "reset" and go back into 1st. Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive. My thoughts: Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely). The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves). My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age. Please feel free to be as technical as you want. :) I'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free beer. <grin> Skoal,	7
Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This, unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly stupid) under that state's law. Gee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law... James	7

If a manual transmission is a "must have", then the M-B 300TE is not in the running. You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America. It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the distributors) are not interested in manual trannies. The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine. All earlier years are 177 hp. I have an '87 300E, with a "mere" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation. More is always nice, but I can't complain. I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall. Here are my impressions: 1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on. 2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously "hook" into the corner. Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful front drive cars. (The CSE is 200hp. Mercedes is rear-drive, so it does not have this problem.) 3) Huge interior and cargo space. 4) The most "rubbery" shifter I have ever encountered. I drove a 5spd. It was absolutely numb. You might be able to get used to it - I don't know. I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right. From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed the car for an automatic. 5) It was rather noisy: Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks. (Mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics.) You should also check out the new BMW 525 "touring". This is a wagon version of the 525i. It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.	7

Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start. Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when the converter gets into its operating range). The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people to the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples license for stupidity.	7

I used to drive a truck a few years back. I once rode with an old codger that had been driving for about 30 yrs. The only time he would use the clutch was to get the truck moving. He could shift that 13 speed lightning quick, up or down, without the slightest rake of a gear. He was as smooth as silk. It was the most amazing shifting demonstration I've ever seen! Having said all that I still don't know why anyone would want to shift a synchronized tranny without a clutch? Why do it?	7
Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between a new car's price and the trade-in's value? I know California charges you on the full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in. If you are a California resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other than California without also paying California sales tax? How does California enforce any law that requires you to also pay California sales tax (on top of the out-of-state tax)?	7

In the EC, the Corrado VR6 is rated as 'best handling car this side of a 968'. As it goes, I just read an article in 'Autocar & Motor' comparing the VR6 to a Ford Probe (later to be launched in the UK).... The VR6 is more powerful (even more so coz its 2.9 instead of 2.8 in the EC) and more fun to drive etc etc... but the Probe has a slightly smoother engine (thanx Mazda MX6!)...	7

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year old BMW is still as sweet as it was new. But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow. I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design flaw in the BMW.	7
I have tested both vehicles (identically equipped), both for week-long periods. Curiously (and consider these are test vehicles), I found the Mercury higher in build quality than the Nissan. Either choice is good, but beware that I did not experience reasonable mileage with the V6. Average city driving was <15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway. Both were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan had leather!). The Villager was in the $24K range and the Nissan was over $26K.	7

I'm new to this group and this may have been discussed already, in which case my apologies, but... I have a '92 Integra with an auto box. According to the manual the car has a lock up torque converter, or something similar. What is it, what does it do and how does it work? (Excuse my ignorance). Does anybody know? --Parms.	7
They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new grille. Otherwise, it is unchanged. Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the LEXUS and hence, they now join the pack. I still wonder if much of the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial AD campaign. Personally, I like the Q without the Grille.	7
The whire wheels aren't chromed, they were to be painted silver/grey. The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be "doggy" because of the light weight of the car. Don't pull the topto make it reach the snaps, I pulled a couple out of the top doing that. Replacing the spanps usually doesn't work. Let it sit in th e sun, open on the car for a couple hours, the try, GENTLY!!!! I continually blew up the #4 connecting rod bearing, be sure your not buring too much oil. Don't expect too much of a smooth ride. The lever arm shocks hold the road, and your bladder. The are ultra-expensive. Supposedly the can be rebuilt. J. C. Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard shocks. I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder, in addition to the clutch slave. This work made a world of changes. Be sure the carb is the original type replacement. My 1970 had dual Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs. Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced. To replace the engine and tranny have to be pulled as a unit.	7
[well, actually, he didn't, but we'll pretend the real author of this query has his name tacked in here....:-)] while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/ targa thing as well. I simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance, nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do. If i chose a convertible, it'd be: a) Mazda RX7 II. I just like the way they look. It'd have to be in black, with color matched black top(they look good!) b) VW cabriolet. They do a suberb job of matching colors too. Also, last year for them! {***COLLECTOR'S ITEM****} c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too. i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-) good luck to your wife.(and you :-)	7

Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all diesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that people keep them going long after the top end is worn out.	7
^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^^ Me thinks thee dost protest too much.... 1/2 :-) He made no allegations, and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the doubt.

All gimmicks! Stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive. Eagle 1, Meguiars, Turtle Wax, and a few others are good examples. The colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so apparent. The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely off with a cleaner/mild abrasive. Never tried Liquid Glass, although I still have this sample they sent me a few years back.	7
Not everyone should be trusted with tools. ;-)	7
We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. Let me ask a similar question from the aviation field. You must have seen images of prop planes with all cylinders exposed. I have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. This arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. How can one crankshaft throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the outside.	7
this is an interesting point. some people are not really buying the coverage, they are buying 'peace of mind', marketing folks love selling that. i suggest that people *choose* to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that 'peace of mind'.	7
Talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are only insurable if they are fitted with a Vecta alarm. We're talking Coswoths and Porsches and stuff. Just before they (the insurance companies) decided to make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a Scorpion alarm ( now they've changed to the Vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting the Scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the Vecta system.	7
Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest; Toyota 4runner: Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise. Nissan Pathfinder: Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has a cheap-looking interior. Isuzu Trooper: Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable, handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge, and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10" shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to park in in San Francisco. No Thanks. Chevy Blazer: Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still too small. Ford Explorer: This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader. But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like, but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10" shorter wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it? Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories? Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially the same vehical? Thanks- -Karl	7
This is kind of interesting. I always assumed that the 240SX was named because of the 2.4 liter engine which it uses. Likewise for the 200SX which uses a 2.0 liter engine. Isn't this true?	7

QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax? This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth. Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax. But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car paint? Can you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks.	7
Sorry 'bout that - Mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with ABS and revised suspension (whatever revised means)). I'm in Australia, so we always seem to get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as standard. My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after an oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm using (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.	7

I was curious as to what people thought of the VW Corrado VR6? That's about it...	7
We were at a dealership today looking at buying a car and the salesman was showing us something he was calling a "buy back". Is that a car that was fleeted and then given back for the new model the next year? If that is so, how many miles is a good number to have on it and are these types of cars generally a good buy?	7
I had a similar experience. We had a written quote which had been mailed to us from the salesman at one of these "no-haggle" Toyota dealers for a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc. The price seemed fair, but when we went in to take them up on their offer, they "discovered" that certain extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote. It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do. Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they don't have to deal. We walked, went out and bought a new LH car (Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!	7
-> 4) Are there any fairly cheap (<$150 or so) ways to increase the -> performance on this car? Unfortunately, a Taurus is not exactly a -> muscle car, so I'm looking for ways to increase the performance. There is a company in Florida that sells computer chips that supposedly get a few HP and Torque out of the 3.0. Don't have the address, but saw the ad in Hot Rod and some other car magazines. Also, you could open up the exhaust (get an exhaust with a larger i.d.) Hope this helps. If you find anything else, let me know. I've got a 1990 Taurus L.	7

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe) I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all models, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right now, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride to school, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in the spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass) would be a better (read "bigger") choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7. Even better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling one?	7

I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL has the ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels). The Caprice was the worst new body style to come out of Detroit EVER! Now just because the LT1 engine and a few suspension tweeks are being added. Its STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE. GM's answer to everything is "throw in a V8 and someone will buy it." Or "add some plastic ground affects and a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it." IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a BLANK sheet of paper. No minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail amp modification, or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine) will help the existing Caprice.	7

I don't know about where you are, but here in California false representation of odometer readings is a criminal felony. If you can substantiate this, you need to report that dealer to the local authorities. You should consult with a lawyer to tell you what civil action you can take as well. Keep in mind that you will have to prove that the dealer was aware of the change in the dashboard.	7

Hi fellow auto enthusiasts! Does anyone have any info on the new 4 valve per cylinder diesels Mercedes is working on?

Thank you in advance for your replies!	7
In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on the T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.	7
reasonable That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get. The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays sticker price is really being ripped off.	7
I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone. It works great. The shock sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have on my other car. It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind, but any kind of shock sets it off. Even kicking the tire sets it off. It works great. The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it. You can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm. Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false alarms with this system. The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence. I have been able to trace every alarm to it's cause and it was not a false alarm. I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle. My Syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this. There are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't have one. I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply. This is primarily for convertibles. I have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail. Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these. It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter. I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on. Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package. It talks to people as they walk by. I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit. The kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind. I am real happy with my Viper. One other feature I really like is you can tune it to your preferences. You can have it arm passively or not. You can disable the chirp for arming/disarming. You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the alarm is armed/disarmed. I like these features. I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine flashes the lights only. I like the door lock feature, although I have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors. But, if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest. I looked seriously at the Alpine system too. It is a real nice system, but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle) than the optional Alpine one, IMHO. I think the Viper gives you a lot of good value for the money. But it isn't absolutely tamperproof. No system is. Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. Anyone know where we can get one of those installed? Maybe that was what they had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>	7
I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. I take VERY serious offence in your statement. I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers? Where did you learn logic? As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.	7

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it. I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v. I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name: the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard sunroof. Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !! So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI ? More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ? There are no badges that said "16v" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version. Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ? (Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)	7

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met: 1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number) 2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver was drunk) 3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever happening). You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save $150/year.	7

Derek.... There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights will come back on after 2-3 weeks. The tool is in fact illegal (in Europe atleast). It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used BMW and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! Other than that, I know of no other tool.... anyone else? About changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they only require it after every 12,000 miles (I am talking about an oil change) Just a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden acceleration etc? If yeah, then the 15,000 M oil change seems quite reasonable. But if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy (a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean all the others will come on every 3k too)	7
Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done it here in CT. I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped. And once you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance. My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!	7
Eve'. I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does anyone have any experience with the following brands? Riken Falken BFG General There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that "noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to a tire dealer? Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again), or is that strictly a speed factor?

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of us bought a 1967 "tranny" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried pig shit came flying out the vents!!!. Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now. When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.	7

After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone with "Pontiac Systems" or "Pontaic Customer Service" or whatever, and inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and Trans Am. BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me nowhere. After being routed to a "Firebird Specialist", I was able to confirm that this is in fact the case. At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio. She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier. As I say, she was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this, feel free to respond. Supposedly, this problem is now solved. Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed Manual transmission. So as of this posting, there is a production hold on these cars. She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts... I'm not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would. Can anyone else shed some light on this?

Yeah, diesels are cleaner than petrol powered cars. They even have catalysts fitted to disels now! Oh and Citroen have even launched the 'First sports diesel car in the world'. Which is probably true if you assume if its for production purposes (Merc-Benz had a prototype which runs on diesel back in around 1968..... it did - and read this! - 200 MPH!!!) ....Shaz....	7
Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its too heavy. As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of power for a full size Blazer. Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the LT1 in it :). It seems like they have a real winner with that engine. Why spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take an LT1? It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.) [talking about Impala SS] Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17" aluminum rims and Eagle GS-C tires. The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: plush police package) with 300 horsepower. I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------- Andrew Krenz -- uznerk@mcl.ucsb.edu | krenz@engrhub.ucsb.edu	7
was Yuppies started Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge after the second or third one (at $12.00 each). 2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you get. They usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting them to a cop.	7
Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to shut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron. This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.	7
Better still, years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used "air". It was called a Rovax. The unit worked very well, the short coming was the seal technology. Where is it today?	7
It seems that there are more and more "bands" available for police radar each month. I have recently purchased (within the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW. While it is not a perfect detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well. Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering. So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the new Super Ka wideband. Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors. Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment? If so, it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine. I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport. Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector. I hope that the flood of new radar bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.	7

anyone else experiencing a similar problem? This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up. Then the clutch shifts smoothly. This chatter started when I moved to the San Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment. The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material. No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.	7
I have a 90 Eagle Talon and I wanted a pair of GTS Headlight covers. Actually, they are turning signal covers since the Talons that year had pop-up lights. I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning signal covers in stock. I asked how much it would be and he told me it would cost me another $40. I thought this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic. Can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?	7
folks, i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months. i am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can be in a better negotiating position to purchase a '93 right when the '94s are coming out. i need something that can comfortably carry 2 adults, 2 kids in car seats, and 2 60-pound dogs. i can probably afford something in the 14k-16k range. i am interested in the SUV's but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford. i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but is above my $$$ range. the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down. can anyone offer any suggestions? i am hoping for something a little more hip than the traditional wagon, and the SUVs look like fun (we do a lot of camping too).	7
I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse. The second time, after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and made it *much* better. However it now makes a "scritch scritch" noise on rough roads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone elses's do this?) I got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie! But then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and I think it may have been a repossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-( I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if "you discover something on your Ford that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc). Something about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford. Those little "you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep" buttons are TERRIBLE. Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad. When someone hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car. They may not associate the sound with a small "jap car" style car (like the Probe is). The mudflaps help a lot. I have always been a 5-speed guy. Almost every car I've ever owned has been a 5-speed. Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I (knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic. But it is a pretty high-tech automatic. It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with torque converter lockup. Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the highway, driving 65-70!. (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I probably made that sentence up). :-) Around town the mileage has been around 25-27, not bad for an automatic. Of course it doesn't have the "control" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out to be very convenient. It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in "we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts" :-) Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe. I've gotten them to fix the worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older. On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears, and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when I tradeed the car. The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long. But the car handles very very very well. It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough surface. Definitely. Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one. The car has a "much more expensive than it actually is" look and feel to it. Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension "interesting". The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road. Yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads. You Hear and feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well. Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash. As mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, "consider the back seat as a parcel shelf". No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not have bought the car! (but it's definitely not a family car)). A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93. The 93 in particular sends out a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX. That "lots of glass" you mentioned is what gives the car the "very good visibility" reports you see in all the write-ups. Most "sports/sporty" cars don't have that good visibility. The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on the GT. Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent exhaust system. I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement. Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, I was/am due a refund from Ford. I applied in February and am Still waiting. :-( Yes. I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental). They did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-( I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm. But I seriously feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.	7

"The Villager-Quest seem like the best of the Cravan/Voyager copies to come along since the Mazda MPV." I'll agree about villager but not MPV -- it's so small that I'd class it as a SUV with an extra seat shoehorned in. To get any rear cargo space, you shove the back seat up against the middle seat, eliminating *all* leg room. Back to the Villager ... "Only the price is controversial." And the use of attack belts instead of 3-point belts. That killed it for me.	7

A mileage chart should be available in the book. It usually goes by the class of car you own and year. Usually you will end up adding a few hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it... Consumer Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area. A friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service. I believe it cost about $10.00.	7
I have the same problem with my '90 probe. The water is definitely not comming up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare. I have to remove the rubber stopper to drain the water. Seems like a common problem with probe.	7
I agree with Jeff's reply. I've never changed the brake fluid except when having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of freeway driving). However, I will start to do this as preventative maintenance on my new car. Also, there are brake system flushing agents that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent. Just for your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.	7
I went to a place called American Car Care Centers to check my car for A/C leak. After "checking", I was told that there is a leak in the compressor seal. At the end, in addition to the labor for the check, I was charged 12 dollars for a pound of freon, although they evacuated my A/C afterwards because of the leak. First, is it fair for him to charge me for a pound of freon ($12 plus tax) ? Second, what can I do about this if this is unfair ?	7
Here in Australia most cars are manual (privately owned anyway). Why?

The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp and 220lb-ft of torque. Plenty off-highway, marginal on the highway. The 93 has a much improved 4.2L straight 6 with >200hp and 275ft-lb torque. If you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference. The Cruiser is an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.	7

Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can say is "it depends". They're both great cars. In fact, my wife and I are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year. The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream. Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in customer satisfaction. They're both very attractive, and hideously expensive. The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX. The 300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful on slippery surfaces.	7
[i agree wholeheartedly!!] not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the standard equipment. Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or so tacked on for that lousy tranny. So you actually ARE paying more, just that it's sometimes hard to find one that is equipped "standard". (this applies to MOST cars, but not to the luxoyachts..eg caddilac, licolns, etc..)	7

s: Ahhh yes, Andrew, we meet again... ...no, not 'stealing' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded. Let me guess, you're from Hudson Ohio?? Get out and see the world. "IF" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could undo. Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks. As well as putting bad things in the gas... While I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that way...	7

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered. If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer, and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search (which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up. Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-) James	7
V4s? I don't know of any. I4s and flat4s are abundant. A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few exceptions). I6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that's still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups. I think that Jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but I'm not a big Jeep person. Where are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs, Lincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size pickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few Japanese and European vee-hickles with V8s.

re: extended Ka bands. I recently bought a 2 band detector. You guys must all think I'm nuts, right? Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states. Here's how I found out: - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know what Ka is. He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah, "Ka stands for K automatic"... duuhh. He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much. - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps, even the real sneaky ones. - When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states. They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of. So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high performance 2 band Escort 2200. Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection. I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.	7
this is off the subject but, Don't the numbers in the car names above refair to the engine size in liters? i.e. ls400 = 4.0litre engine, sc300 = 3.0 liter "Sport Coupe".. and Q45 = 4.5liter.. (similar, kinda, to BMW and MB nameing deal).	7

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc. These cars look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one of the most beatiful cars ever made.	7

Having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said it was probably totaled), I am in the market for a another vehicle. I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me. Namely: 1. Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)? 2. Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult? 3. One power window and the power seat do not work, are these expensive items to replace if I do the work myself? 4. How long do the engines usually last( 90M+ now)? 5. Any other experiences good or bad, and opinions.	7
Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys are _really_ paranoid! You're actually worried about somebody stealing your oil? C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?! That's absolutely ridiculous! Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to change the oil? I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and changed the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it gets easier. I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.	7
My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops). My current car is a convertible. IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top, sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it. There's no substitute for a convertible. If you're not after that sun beating down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'. So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call it a convertible. And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll bar in a rollover situation. Of course, I'd rather not test it in MY car. I, too, am in my early 40s. A convertible--accept no substitute.	7

[Much discussion about economics of safety deleted] This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision (less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last generation Suburban HIC numbers). As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt?	7
I think it was the reverse, the V4 being 2/3 of the V6. It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit van. Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight four from the Triumph.	7
I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. (autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method. anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is: Cd = d/(q*2R) where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder. To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.	7

foot in mouth again, drew. the first generation mr 2's were 1.6's which were very smooth. i'd be real surprised if the original poster was talking about a 1st generation car. the second generation cars were 2.2 for the non turbo and 2.0 for the turbo. i drove the non turbo 2.2 and calling it unpleasant is to be kind to it.. wrong and wrong. mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance shafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only for the us market suckers. i guess we need to write to C&D and start telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm. then you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine A has peak vibrations 3 dB less than engine B, therefore engine A is better than engine B. 1/2 :-)	7
Excerpts from rec.autos: 26-Apr-93 Re: REVIEW: 1989 Ford Tauru.. by Mark W. Rice@mozart.Colu david.bonds@cutting.hou.tx.us (Dav One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this one, too). While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the gears grind.... You will just glide back.	7
released here we go again... now these are just rumors.. so dont quote me. New Integra supposedly wedge shaped again. 175 hp and all-wheel drive in top models. Then a variant called the zx-r comes later. (roadster?). i think it gets unveiled at end of summer.	7
Hi there, maybe you can help me... I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says. The gearbox seems excessivly clunky. I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as bad as this car! Is there fluid in the 5speed case? If there is, could it just be low, or in need of a change? As I recall, only the autos have fluid. Or am I just mistaken? Please no flames for owning an import. I also have an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...	7
Just a quick, simple question really... How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan Maxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear wheels. Also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? Enough to lock wheels at 30mph? Hmmmm... I just have to wonder about some of the things I hear...	7
What??? I heard there was a new engine slated for the mustang...something like 280hp (ok, it was from one of their other lines...)... --	7

The last V8 in Mad Max is based on a Holden (Australia). Holden is linked with GM (Vauxhall GB) and so they're quite unlikely to use Ford parts.	7
I is a strong deterent to the teens that are executed. They won't do that again! This policy cuts way down on repeat offenders. Please do not flame me - I don't agree with capital punishment for teen's. They are also unsupervised. With proper supervision, they would not be throwing rocks. If parents cannot provide the minimal supervision needed to stop this activity, they should not be allowed to have children :-) Notice the smiley ;-)	7
Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925 to 1935. They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put the crimp on luxury cars. It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse power. "They don't make them like they used to." There were others though. Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down sized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years. Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure. Most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with V16 if they did not actually produce them. There was actually a "cylinder war" among the Big Three to see who could produce the biggest engine. Big M	7
You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240? Just curious.. We also have a nissan predacessor (sp) to the 240 called a 200, which came in turbo and nonturbo. But i don't think we've ever had a 240 turbo...just curious...(BTW, I'm in the US, if that matters..)	7
I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced. I use S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers. In my car it smoothed the idle and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees. I havent used it long enough to test for wear, but some people I know have. A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors at least every other year if not every year. Since he has been using S-50 he has went 5 years without an overhaul. Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time. These coustomers had ran S-50 since almost new. It was found when measuring the internals of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be expected of 30K miles not 200K.	7
Actually, I've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage junk mail in along with whatever else into *anybody's* prepaid envelopes until they almost burst.

Hi, I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi Galant GS transmission. The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission. Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd, unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a "popping" or "hitting" sound. The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say this is NORMAL for the car. IS IT? And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse: 1- The shifter would not budge. The clutch had no effect. 2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is fully depressed. 3- If the clutch is released the engine would die. 4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck, I could not make the car move. It acted as if it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.) 5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch), while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter. 6- The shifter acted normally after that. When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k. I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last week. The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car. In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage, and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily solving the problem). And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck. I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, and with how to handle Mitsubishi. All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to bore you with the long post.	7

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any relevant newsgroups in my area. For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used? I'm especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior experiences, if possible). For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk of being caught. You can always detect radar, but there's no way to fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are. Thanks a lot,	7
Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)... I was debating with a co-worker about diesels. I claimed they were cleaner-burning than gas engines. He said the extra "junk" put out by them was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses. I made all the SAME claims you did. But, one question of his was what about the carbon? I said it was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it. I suggested scrubbers. (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install than "cats".) Does there exist any designs for a scrubber? (I'd like to know just to answer his final question.) I convinced him that diesels are cleaner otherwise. BTW, (I named my subject "Dirty Diesels" because I knew it would get a reaction out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd read it...) -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -- Vel Natarajan nataraja@rtsg.mot.com Motorola Cellular, Arlington Hts IL --	7

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy. Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON, April 21 -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a "driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies." President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order. "I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen," O'Leary said. "As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country." The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation. "The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country," O'Leary said. "Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs. We believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals." O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical. Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available. -30-	7
Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim ============================================= Background: Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass. I have been interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week. I bought a remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800. As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out. As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments. However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I can get this for $230 from any Ford service center. In addition, the car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment. For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate. The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents, although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway. Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car. To my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems just as nimble as my Celica! (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile. :-) Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and in front of the C-pillar and rear window. Parallel parking is a bit more difficult, but other than that, I love the size. In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer. More on the ride later in this review. Engine: As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha "Shogun" engine. I was not disappointed. Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is good. You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although I don't make a practice of this. The engine revs smoothly and eagerly -- tooling around town does not require many shifts. This is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car. (More on this later.) While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit higher revs. At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up. The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around. The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm! I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am. To go from 2000 rpm to 4000, you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves are used. Transmission: When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car. I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff. That was back then. The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a Ford recall in 1991. The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the one on my Toyota Celica. In fact, the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving. When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter felt very reasonable. The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect it to be, and the shifting action was smooth. On the road, it's much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY! Make no mistake, it's a clumsy shifter. When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift. I find this pretty amazing in a car like this. It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time. Seems obvious, but compared to my Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy. Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter. I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more reasonable. When you play within these bounds, the shifter works smoothly with no surprises. I don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all. Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly. Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely. This took several days for me to get the hang of. (I think some of my problems were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears.) Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse. The shifter refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear. I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months. A quirk: When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500 rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment. Not terribly loud, but the passenger can definitely hear it. I asked about it when I was looking at the car, as do all my passengers. Apparently, this is a definitely a "SHO sound" and is the gearbox -- apparently called "gear rollover". Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review. Exterior: As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this SHO has stood up. Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non-existent. Looking at how older Tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did differently to the SHO bodies. The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock Tauri. For some odd reason, the SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination. :-) SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with "SHO" stenciled in relief. I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black. Yuck. I don't think the car is flashy. I like it that way. I feel almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care. :-) Interior: The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the car. The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in a black/grey/metallic scheme. The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach. You get a center console with two cupholders, a large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding cassette tapes. There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small glove compartment. I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink. Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design. And it's a 1989, before the interior was upgraded! The backseat is bigger than any car I've had. Why do they need so much space? :-) (No smart-ass comments, please. :-) The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters. From what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear. Mine is no exception. The left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way. A big surprise for me: I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal hand parking brake. Instead, they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot. Too bad. Again, I'm getting used to it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me. Ride: The suspension is nice and stiff. Too stiff? It's stiffer than any car I've had. A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better. The SHO seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps. Driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair. On the other hand, taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I listened for that before I bought the car. On the highway, the ride is great. When I drove the car from Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like. It's a relatively quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles. I've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails. No easy way to get rid of it, I think. Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough. (Not for me, mind you. But I wonder whether I would advise my dad to buy one for himself.) But, I've discovered, as with the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason to complain. Let me explain... The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels. I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right. After I understood this, I avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again. It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car. As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy. My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds. It tracks straight as an arrow, but when driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so useful. However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT. IMHO, it's much better than the steering on my Celica ST. I wonder how bad this car is during winter? Miscellaneous notes: GRIPES: The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went. Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as it retracts on its rails. I wonder if there is a quick fix for this. Again, other days it completely disappears. (Function of humidity?) Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer, I've never complained about ride. I wish the seats had more support under the thighs. Also, I wish the side bolsters would close more tightly. I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive. I currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500 for four. I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it to use a volume *paddle*? Now, to my amazement, I don't really mind... and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!! Pretty ridiculous, though. Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore. But, this is no big deal. There is more than enough torque down low. I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends. It took me a couple of days before I could really shift smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear. (Hard to believe, isn't it?) My car has almost 93,000 miles on it. My parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. Astute observation, IMHO. I wonder how long I can make my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled "Drive It Forever" for tips in this department. :-) The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop. I once parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch after I started it. The car jolted forward, and bounced off the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal! Also, I began to wonder how strong that brake really is. (Today, I backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed the glowing brake light. Oops.) The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way. The same thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable. Oddly, all the other windows work smoothly. LIKES: I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day. The cupholders are great. I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but it really is handy. You can lock all the doors by pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together! Neat! And you can never lock yourself out of the car. I really feel like I don't deserve this car. I really can't believe that I could afford it. I got this car ten years ahead of schedule. :-) I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to look into buying one. I love this car so much that I wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this. If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car. I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO. For under $7000, you can't beat it. (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.) Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win. I pay the same premiums as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower. Other Odds and Ends: Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere. Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void. I haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still appear on rec.autos about once a month. Owners of SHOs are always quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars. (Maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos. :-) I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as well as other posts with useful information on these cars. I'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ soon. If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up! I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but maybe someone out there does.	7

Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new to our species... What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The religious persecutions of the middle-ages? What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans? The Jews persecuted by Christians? There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a thousand years ago! There is nothing new about violence.	7

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss. So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering. At least, that's how I understand it.	7
And here's my two cents: The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise. The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles. --	7

Does anyone have one of these that would care to share some information on? I concerned about the turbo. How reliable is it? How's the gas milage. Please responde to me, not here. Thank you.	7
{Stuff Deleted} {Stuff Deleted} {More Stuff Deleted} My neighbor runs a Viper(R) distributorship and installs them on all Saturns sold in my area (Anne Arundel County, MD). He has an SC with the Viper voice alarm installed. The alarm does everything, turn on the car, the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors... The alarm goes off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by. It gets sensitive up to about 5 feet in 85degree heat. It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms, because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says "Protected by Viper, please stand back!" And shuts up... (mainly because the person walks away befuddled!!!")	7
To anyone with experience about Honda Civic (EX or DX) or Saturn SL1: I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image. Another question: what would I expect to pay for a Civic EX coupe with automatic, air, and an AM/FM radio? Mail to the address below or post to this group. Thanks, Rob	7
Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have. My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut. I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts. Unfortunately, I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts. :-( My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn. They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the package and I verified it myself). I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership. I did have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing.	7
I would guess the high price of gas in Europe (compared to the US) has always favoured 4-cylinder manuals. small engines with autos are a real bore... But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in the US? My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on. And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

I also experience this kinda problem in my 89 BMW 318. During cold start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. But after preheating, it becomes smooth again. I think that your suggestion of being some humudity is right but there should be some remedy. I also found out that my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!	7
xIf you put a locking lugnut on your tires, do you need to have your xtires rebalanced?? x xJohn Mas x xE-Mail Address :: MAS@SKCLA.MONSANTO.COM Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are not normally involved, how would they do that? I would think that since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would not have any noticable effect on the balance.

Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars. They have been known to be very picky. No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland insurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos. Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want you. They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. "We must insure all the cars". I think this rep didn't know what she was talking about. Geico is cheap. But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped. I think in most areas two tickets will do it. Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.	7

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata. I know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that have them swear by them. They also haven't had the problems with them that Consumer Reports claims. I haven't driven one yet. I have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also trashed) and was very impressed with it. The local Hyundai dealership ("no-haggle" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power moonroof for $13163. They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for $13997. I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and 4-spd automatic. I'll decide which engine I prefer after test driving both the 4-cyl and the V6. The Sonata is also offering a $1500 rebate. Hmmm, that's another question. Is the following scenario the appropriate manner to handle "negotiation"? 1. make offer 2. subtract rebate from offer 3. talk trade 4. subtract trade from offer to get final price	7
Or the price tag of the RX7 vs. a Mustang? Part of the definition of a Mustang is that it should be affordable by the masses. Of course Ford knows youre argument, THEY OWN A BIG PIECE OF MAZDA! Take a good look at a Mach III, now an RX7, hhhmmmmm... That is a tragedy, but I don't think new Camaros or the new Mustangs will. -Steve	7
From: nataraja@rtsg.mot.com (Kumaravel Natarajan) The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of: 1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged. 2. All use an "aftercooler", which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI). 3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low. No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used. The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free. Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures. One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power, and these are approved by the CARB.	7

Hello again. Anyone here done any tinting work. What are the best brands out there? How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that. Also I would consider having it professionally done, how much around Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid) Thanks for all the info... Ps. What is the maximum legal tint limit.	7
The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too. It's annoying. Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is high. The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is a "self-adjusting hydraulic design". Yeah, right.	7

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them. Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4: 1) Servotronic steering: [For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and used in Audis and BMWs.] I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd. I am quite happy to report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*. I suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that I have tried. It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is ruined. The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver's hands. So there is feel and there is accuracy in the S4's steering. But there is also room for improvement. I consider the S4's steering to be better than the Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in "feel" and engineer it out completely. 2) Engine Wheee! What a pressure cooker. With just 110 miles on the clock I did not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific punch. For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving. i.e. low revs, high gear. It is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion. With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph. A chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s. The technical achievement is breadthtaking. Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts are almost unnecessary. It is more fun to use the "overboost" feature than to rev the engine. For those not familiar, the S4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing. Sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by flooring the gas. As far as the numbers go, maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter. It takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for. Since this is quite a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado VR6. The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff. Also, one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger.. Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000. The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW. I'd say that in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s. However, lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined. The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost. Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical, with a rorty race car growl when pressed, though none of these can match its grunt. The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop. With the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine. I think that Audi of America should offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8. The characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic. Ironically, in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush. Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again... 3) Chassis I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths. The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16.. which is not uncommon at all. However, the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever. Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth watering macho, yet subdued look. On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I digress. To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved out of stone. Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough roads. With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars. The servotronic steering has already been mentioned. I consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering. I was able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I think a new concept is at work in this car. With its fat gumball tires, talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless. On a banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I went around. I could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways. Yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the limits were not even close to being approached. The g forces were thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving. You tell the car what you want and it does it. End of story. I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car. The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade. I am not too surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi 100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold. I am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity. The LS400's fade performance is nothing to brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's. Brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on anti-lock capability. 4) Comfort For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also excellent. The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4. All the expected gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this and that. The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the car has no boost gauge. A real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance. Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch. Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer. 5) Conclusion Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition. The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds. No other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is worth the extra money all by itself. The safety features are also top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags. The 100 series Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests. It gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating.	7
Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?) Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least, by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure on the rotor. Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec). There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.	7
I am in the market to buy a used car. I am particularly interested in the Pontiac Bonneville. My budget is between 7- 8 thousand. Would I be able to afford an 88 or 89. What engines were available at this time. I know they didn't redesign until the 1992 model year. How is the reliability of past models. I would appreciate any advice or information.	7
Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non turbo fuel injection. There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say "Go to authorized mazda dealer.". It is really good idea. Don't you think so? I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ? Youjip Won	7
I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own question? Is the reflected signal "shifted" at all from the act of being reflected? If so, wouldn't it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources?	7
Unfortonately, that truly is about the best summation of the research that there is. Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer, (which, interestingly, occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor), simplicity of personal hygiene, prevention of urinary tract infections, and prevention of a unretractible foreskin, Disadvantages include infection from the procedure, pain, etc. I apologize; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head. I will post what I discovered in research; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school. It really is a decision that is up to the parents. Some parents use the reasoning that they will "look like Daddy" and like their friends as justification. There is nothing wrong with this; just be sure it is what you want to do, since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male, although a major surgical procedure exists. As long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any problems with your pregnancy, it should be OK to sit in a tub of water. HOWEVER, I WOULD RECOMMEND USING YOUR OWN BATHTUB IN YOUR OWN HOME! It is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of "public" hot tubs. A nice warm bath can be very relaxing, especially if your back is killing you! And it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection. Hope these tips help you some.	13
Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes. New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes: Results to Be Reported To: National Desk, Health Writer Contact: John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber, 310-444-7000, or 800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research Institutes. LOS ANGELES, April 28 -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif. Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology. Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS. Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes. An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes. By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy. In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding, "this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain." Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study. In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease. Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate. This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine. "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease. For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study. Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N. The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon. For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology May issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877. Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease: What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused? Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer. As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death. How many people does it affect? Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year. While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families. AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults. Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset. What are its signs and symptoms? Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition. The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90. In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD. One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness" caused by short-term memory loss. Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and suggests the following criteria: -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal. -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious. -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal. -- Forgetting how to get home is serious. Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. -30-	13
I don't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS -- I'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does. Do you really think that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS? For what it's worth, I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin for "candida hypersensitivity syndrome." It was published in the New England Journal (I think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic symptoms (though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not surprisingly). As I recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections to the study, though I don't remember what they were.	13

But no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off God as a scientific fact. Not so with Kirlian photography.

I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries. There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one's calcium intake. Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition? The study didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large- ly calcium." Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention of kidney stones. I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

Hello all, There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I would appreciate any help at all with it. My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these. So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with different but unbearable side effects. The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to sit still for more than a minute or so. The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded over. The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco- ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was "closed down". Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next step? Thankyou in advance.	13

Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties. Too much can block the external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some hearing problems. It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your own, or at your physician's office. You can take a syringe (no needles!) and fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen peroxide. Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up) and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and firmly expell the solution. Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses. If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-). You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever you may have. If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker. You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax. Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again. It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse it out. Good Luck -heather	13

Money probably has a lot to do with keeping the practice of routine circumcision alive... It's another opporitunity to charge a few hundred extra bucks for a completely unnecessary procedure, the rationale for which until recently has been accepted without question by most parents of newborns. One could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision (infections, sloppy jobs, etc) are far more common than the remote chance of penile cancer it is purported to prevent.	13
A person with a Schatzki's ring (a membrane partially blocking the espphagus) has worsening dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and the doctor proposes dilation by balloow or bougie (using an inflatable balloon to rupture the ring or a rubber hose to push through it. Question: is balloon dilation safe, common, and indicated? It sounds pretty invasive. Yes, this is a common and safe procedure. The majority of Schatzki's rings described by x-ray, however, wnd up being due to inflammation instead of the congenital Schatzki's ring. Occassionally a cancer masquerades as a ring. You should have the endoscopy to see if it is due to the heartburn, and if so, you will need treatment for the heartburn ong term. The balloon dilation is an alternative to cutting open your chest and cutting out a section of the esophagus, so dilation is not at all invasive, considering the alternative. 3 to 4 years, and once was symptomatic from them, with some lightheadedness. He is young, (30-ish), thin and in good I' not an expert on heart problems, but PVC's are common and have been overtreated in the past. My personal experience, and I have the same history an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's come and go, with some months causing anxiety. Taking on more fluids seems to help, and they seem worse in the summer. Remember that a slow heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that last point, especially) Good luck, hope we don't die of arrhythmias.

Hi, I'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo- genics. The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. There are all sorts of warnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect.. The silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not require a change in diet. Is this possible? Are the pills dangerous or just hoaxes?	13
I too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974. (These are not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats. This is how they feel, and this is how I described them initially to the doctor, but they're actually *premature* heartbeats. I would sometimes experience a lapse after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) I had them persistently for eighteen years. Then I went on a low-fat diet, and they just stopped. I haven't had a single episode of PVH for almost two years. I know: correlation does not imply causation. This is just FWIW.	13
Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems: First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it, the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular, if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort. My doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone comment on safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this, especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation, reaction to anesthesia). The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24 hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this, however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn't feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the same time. Thanks for any help/advice!	13
Could some please refer me to someone who can perform PRK (Photo Refractive Keratostomy) in Canada (preferably eastern portion). I've looked in the yellow pages with little success, and if someone has had a good (or bad, for that matter) experience, that would be especially helpful if you could please let me know.	13
My (then) wife used to get recurrent yeast infections. One day, her doctor sent her home with medication for her and a pill for me. I took the pill, upon her insistence, and was very relieved the next day when I looked it up in the PDR. It only RARELY causes testicular atrophy...	13
I am writing this to find out the following: 1.) Any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis. 2.) The name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery. 3.) Information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer. My boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago. At that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (Mylanta, Tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed. These treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago. He was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a Nissen wrap and a "Hill Repair". He opted for the "Hill Repair". He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva). The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called "Barrett's Syndrome". If he can't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer? Basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, I'd appreciate it. Thanks,	13
I think I can explain the "missing part of a leaf" story. I have actually seen a reproduction of that particular Kirlian photograph, in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of Kirlian photography. "That particular photograph" ... ? That's right, the effect has been observed only once. Even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in it. I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo. For his next experiment, he cut the leaf in half, put one half down between the same two plates, and took another K. p. The "missing half" effect was created by water, oils, etc. left behind after the first photo. This explanation must be tentative, because after all I wasn't there when it happened.	13
Nor is it mine. What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections. Marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists. Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group. I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora). However, it is NOT part of my routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria after antibiotics. I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients. Whether or not it is a "logical extension" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials. One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora. Don't try this at home. Except that it isn't. At least symptomatically apparent disease. Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical trial, like: AU Dismukes-W-E. Wade-J-S. Lee-J-Y. Dockery-B-K. Hain-J-D. TI A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments] SO N-Engl-J-Med. 1990 Dec 20. 323(25). P 1717-23. psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently, the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted. Does this trial address every issue raised here, no. Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin). Maybe they didn't avoid those carbohydrates . . . Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms. There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials. Are we talking about "real" candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc). We can't seem to focus in on a disease, a therapy, or a hypothesis under discussion.	13
The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis. It is a protozoan that lives and multiplies within cells. In cats, the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces. The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus. The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born, or it may be very severe. Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation. Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox. In addition, whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else, especially food. Information came from _The Merck Manual, 15th Ed._ I hope this information is helpful to you.	13
Re: serious discussion about drugs vs. "Where can I get a good bong, man?"	13
This question came up in Sci. Med. Nutrition and I'm posting my answer here. Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition. We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community. I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS. So many women(and their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening. Before shooting your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified. From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: side-tracked with candida. PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most physicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity. Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS. Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups: PMT-A(Anxiety) PMT-D(depression) anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy PMT-C(Craving) PMT-H(Hyperhydration) craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headache edema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle. PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates. During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge. The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1. This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia. A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid. PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women's cycle. Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972). PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level. Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form: A. "Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for a nutritional approach". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986. B. "Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983). C. "Premenstrual tension", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms). While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better. There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms). Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done). Here are a few of these studies: CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet 2:128-32(1988). 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training. After 6 months, there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, tenderness and nodularity. VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960). 218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo. Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml). The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS. 48% getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS. Only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms. 10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS symptoms. Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms. After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms. Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped. PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was stopped. Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver. These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS. Of all the vitamins given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best single effect. This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver. Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS. But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity. VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989). 32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo. After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months. B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness). Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation. Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987). 55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months. Analysis of convergence showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction) Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 supplementation. Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women. Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man. Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day. The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear. Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried. Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day. VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha- tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo. Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo group. For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group. Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo. After 2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT-A and PMT-C. The 300IU dose was needed to significantly improve PMT-D. No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H (other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT-H symptoms). MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache 31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo. Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group. Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores. Pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from PMS. After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range. Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow. After 2 cycles, both groups received magnesium. The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation. In addition, the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation. The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during PMS. There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature. But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them. There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS. I've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder. But doctors don't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, pellagra, scruvy, etc.). PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition. PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders. It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses. Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS. Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med. Res.5(1):8-11(1991). 200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, zinc and primrose oil. The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate diet. On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from PMS. Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987). A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and placebo. After 6 months on the experimental program, the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle. Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J. Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 tablets per day) or a placebo. The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo. Another group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo. For this second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was observed.

There's always the old switcheroo. My brother works at a dialysis clinic. They were interviewing candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a urine screen was part of the interview. The bathroom was across the hall from a lab. One candidate managed to switch his urine sample with one he grabbed from the lab. (No one was in it at the time.)	13

Does anyone know how posionous centipedes and millipedes are? If someone was bitten, how soon would medical treatment be needed, and what would be liable to happen to the person? (Just for clarification - I have NOT been bitten by one of these, but my house seems to be infested, and I want to know 'just in case'.)	13
How is it that placebos are legal? It would seem to me that if, as a patient, you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever), there's a few legal complications that arise: 1. If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice. 2. A placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?) 3. Getting what you pay for. (Deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...). False advertising (what if McDonalds didn't put 100% pure beef in their hamburgers?) So I'm mystified. Are these assumptions erred? If they aren't, why the hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo?	13
nnget 93122.1300541 And where do you advise people to turn for cancer information? Most It seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of Moss's organization. Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable? Could it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests. Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument. If one sees a possibility, however, that these interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight. As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense here. Of course they didn't! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their survival. Anyone who looks at the NIH's record for investigation of 'alterna- tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.	13
I've mentioned this study a couple of times now: Ingestion of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal vaginitis, Annals of Internal Medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7. Do you have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)? The study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of yogurt. There was a marked decrease in infections while women were ingesting the yogurt. Problems with the study included very small numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only 21 patients were analyzed). Still, the difference in rates of infection between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly believable.	13

I decided to come back and amend this so it quotes me and has added comments... before you had a pat of butter, now you need a medium apple (probably microwave the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet. If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now. are pregnant. If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. Also, I don't think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )	13
There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological (esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games (e.g. Nintendo). Apparently, there have been reported several cases of "photosensitive epilepsy", due to the flashing of some patterns and the strong attention of the (young) players. One poster to comp.risks reported some action from the British Government. A quick search in a database reported the following two published references: 1. E.J.

My ENT doctor told me that it is not uncommon for the wife to get a vaginal yeast infection after the husband takes antibiotics. In fact this recently happened to my wife. Explanation is that the antibiotics kill the yeast's competition, they then thrive and increased yeast around the penis spread the infection during intercourse. I was on ceclor for 30 days, then my wife got the yeast.	13
Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A( retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection). The types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing process. The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't know if they are still capable of responding in adults. If they are capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss. With all of the medical interest in vitamin A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using vitamin A to reverse hearing loss. But with only a news announcement to go on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on your question anymore than I already have. If one study has been done, more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing loss if there really is one.	13

Millipedes, I understand, are vegetarian, and therefore almost certainly will not bite and are not poisonous. Centipedes are carnivorous, and although I don't have any absolute knowledge on this, I would tend to think that you're in no danger from anything but a concerted assault by several million of them.	13
Hi. My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?) tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language, but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach? Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this affect the treatment, development? I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.

Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly. There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones. There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists. Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who. Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon. Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody. Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out, sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment, sometimes they find it's incurable. There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.	13
I have been struck down this past week by a stomach bug and fever which went away quickly when treated with an antibiotic. The pharmacist told me the antibiotic is effective against a wide variety of "gram-negative bacteria." I was wondering where I might have acquired such a bacteria. Could they hang out in swimming- pool water, or would the chlorine kill them? Feeling better, I am	13
I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one book out there..at least one :). There were several types of eye dominance. Where a person looks in their memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading. I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. Although people with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger eye.	13
See the rec.pets.cats FAQ or any doctor or vet for more information. I am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats. It is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before preparing or eating meals. The latter is sound advice at any time of course. Apart from that, its no great problem. You certainly do not need to get rid of your cats. Paul.	13
(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think. The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail. It was also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing weather. Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world. Instead, they expected him to die at sea. Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles, making the trip practical. Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is indeed 25K miles. Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles. My source is the recent PBS series on Columbus. )	13
Greeting I am starting work on a project where I am trying to make strain gages bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months. I am currently using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and I have tried M-bonding the gages to the bone. Apart from those two application methods there doesn't seem to be much else in the literature. I have only an engineering background not medical or biological. I would be interest in any ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone. Thanks for oyur help in Advance.	13

I used to be on lopid. It did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295 down to around 214), as well as LDL and triglycerides. Then, I got pneumonia, and for some reason, the Lopid stopped working very well; cholesterol and triglycerides soared. The levels might have stabilized over time, but a new doctor had me quit, wait a month, then switch to Mevicore. On Mevicore, my total cholesterol was down to 207, LDL was 108, and HDL was 35; but the trig's were still very high, around 318, and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal, SGOT = 83 (N = 1-35), GGTP(?hard to read copy) = 42 (N = 0 - 35). He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern, and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures. He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ("Just to be extra cautious, though I'm sure it's not a problem."), and wants me to go back on it after that. I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice, and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do. But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of.	13
I've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy. Somehow I've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text file. Gordon R. had promised to send it back to me but he's pretty mad at me right now so I'll just retype it. Since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has them). I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical community. Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long time. Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A). When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin. Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which I've already covered). Big mistake(in my opinion). Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well. It's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite). Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and beta-carotene). Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic. Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%). The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP). A normal human adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored. We are born with 10,000IU in our liver. U.S. autopsy has shown that about 30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they were born with. If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect you. But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S. The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of vitamin A. For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A. Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet. But the NRC(National Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to 7,500IU per day for adult males). That report and it's recommendations was killed. Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason. RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient reserves full. Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress. The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill the reserves). We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU). I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how much somebody has stored. We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol). The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl. Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book). This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A toxicity. Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in this post. Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain). I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full. You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies). Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol. But taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU). One other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc. In addition, the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A. Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection? The body uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things. Vision(the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A. Reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal. Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid. How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid? You use enzymes, one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A). Vitamin C does play a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid. If you increase your intake of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid. But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body. This is why the 1985 NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's. Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping themselves. If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do themselves more harm than good. Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system. The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first line" defense against infection. For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide). Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration and cell promotion. For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters are not that important. But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene. Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be adequate. I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already has on it's list of causes for chronic infection). I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures. Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol. The serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU. Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled out). In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl. As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels. What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A? Here are excerpts from their book: Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth. Protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and metabolism of vitamin A. Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision. The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum. The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl. Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores. Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A. Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children. Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state. The bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected. A daily intake of more than 7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois (bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue. They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults. Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative. I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in adults that are having problems with chronic infection. They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give them the zinc along with the vitamin A. At 25,000IU per day, toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol. Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A. I don't suggest that my students use these high doses. If you wanted to fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the serum retinol level, then you would be okay. But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good) without having to worry about toxicity. If they want to get more agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol. But vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus. The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18,000IU of retinol per day. Beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus. Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help? Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop. My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full. Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors. But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.	13

I'll tell you all that I know about chromium. But before I do, I want to get a few things off my chest. I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts. Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart disease and cancer. When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor. Nothing can be further from the truth. Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out. But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor. You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here). When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it. Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, plan and simple. If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done). Her gynocologist even scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa). One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist. This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body. But you talk about flying blind, man this is really blind treatment. No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used. I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money, it may well be. But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook. My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress. That's where I'm coming from folks. Blast away if you want, I'm not going to change. Put me in your killfile if you want, I really don't care. I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say. But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind. That's life. Chromium is one of the trace elements. It has a very limited(but very important) role in the body. It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF). GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine and glutamic. Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF. Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast, and black pepper). When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%). But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest for all the minerals). I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a "fat burner". Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm. I wouldn't do it though. The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day. The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet. Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency. I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there also seems to be a negative one as well. I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability. When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative. In addition to Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising. Glucoma is a little more interesting. Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function. If this eye focusing activity is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated. In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991). But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements. For one thing, just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast). Since glucoma is often found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's. If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would prompt some attention. I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma. You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis. Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium. There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them. There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now. Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium. They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs). This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will. What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation). Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day. What's my advise? Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way). If you want to take them and then exercise, that would be great. Do include yeast as part of your diet(most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet). If you do have a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status. When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just say, please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance. If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you very much.	13
Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA? My uncle has emphesema, and a doctor wants to try it on him. We are wondering if: 1. Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his condition, or any condition? 2. What possible side effects are there. How can they be mimimized? Please respond via e-mail to rme1@cornell.edu	13
Candida can do that to you. :-) Gordon, I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen(just like it does in the vagina). As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out. The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window. Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very important one). The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).	13
Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable ones to give feedback on this. Let me explain. One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old). Otherwise, she is in fine health. The discovery was made via CAT scans. She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered in her lungs. Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma. One spot is in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax. The oncologists believe the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked until four years ago). Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are the chances for full remission/recovery? Thanks. Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>> INFJ Club.	13
Speaking of educational systems, I recently had a colleague tell me that the reason one of our fifth grade students is so physically developed is because she was sexually abused as a younger child. This, she went on to say, kicks the pituitary gland into action and causes puberty.	13

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term "candida bloom" means, but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use. This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the "quack" diagnosis that has been being discussed. Lucky how? Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily. It turns out most would rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections. Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed. There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a quack therapy.	13
Point 1: I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole "yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words. Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers). For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication. One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor. There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames. This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional "difficult" patient. Point 2: I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial. To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice. And it follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known. Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view. And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment. However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations. After all, the underlying intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment. What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints. In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that. The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then). The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them. This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor. It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient. And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community: either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training. This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way. Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion. Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure "scientific" approach to medicine. I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and by the "scientific" aspects. Anything else is just not good medicine, imho. Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess. :^) Comments? Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>> INFJ Club.	13
I have just started taking allergy shots a month ago and is still wondering what I am getting into. A friend of mine told me that the body change every 7 years (whatever that means) and I don't need those antibody-building allergy shots at all. Does that make sense to anyone?	13
This is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said. If your wife's pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll need insulin replacement. That doesn't mean she's "dependent" on insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere. Oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and it's really the only effective therapy available anyway. Plus, it's cheap. Taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a _feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing enough. There isn't a clinical phenomenon of "thyroid insufficiency" caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no worry about inappropriately "suppressing" the thyroid gland. Homeopathy is nonsense. Tell her to stop wasting her money, health and time, and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy.	13
I am looking for statistics on the prevalence of disorders that are treatable with Botulinum Type A. These disorders include: facial dyskinesia, meige syndrome, hemifacial spasm, apraxia of eyelid openeing, aberrant regeneration of the facial nerve, facial paralysis, strabismus, spasmodic torticollis, muscle spasm, occupational dystonia (i.e. writers cramp, etc.), spasmodic dysphonia, and temporal mandibular joint disease. I realize many of the disorders I listed (such as "muscle spasm" !!) are vaguely defined and may encompass a wide range of particular disorders. My apologies; the list was provided to me as is. I have some numbers, but not reliable. Any ideas on sources or, even bbetter, any actual figures (with source listed)? Many thanks, - Meg	13
Well, I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis. Their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions, relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or doxylamine (Unisom) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally. Chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work well in some people. Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.	13
Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, Uncle Sam!). I've been wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be acceptable. They are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to your hearing curve. They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the ear models, that's not an issue). The cost: I paid $1200 each for mine, through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears. I've heard that there is a substantial discount for senior citizens, but I haven't researched that, because I'm not a senior citizen, yet! Give them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised!	13

Copyright 1993, Information, Inc., Bethesda, MD ================================================================= April 19, 1993 ================================================================= "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Orthopedic Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269, No. 14, P. 1807 (von Reyn, C. Fordham) The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to patient is extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures, write C. Fordham von Reyn et al. of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. The researchers contacted 2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992. The orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for HIV. A total of 1,174 former patients underwent HIV testing, representing 50.7 percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the 13.5-year period. Patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure. All patients were found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay. Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery. The examination of AIDS case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of HIV infection among former surgical patients. The estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was $158,000, with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing. This accounted for 37 percent of the total expense. The patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study. Notifying patients of the infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \ ================================================================= "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of an HIV- Infected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 38 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 269, No. 14, P. 1795 (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple, methodologically similar investigations, writes Audrey Smith Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. The researchers identified a total of 1,131 persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon. The AIDS case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained. Among the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 had test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in 1985 during a transfusion. There was no HIV transmission in 369 person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours of surgical exposure. The researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection-control guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested, and of those whose results were revealed, only one person was found to be infected with HIV. The study patient's infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985. As a result, there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the HIV-positive surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers conclude. ================================================================== April 20, 1993 ================================================================== "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10 (Kolata, Gina) A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a highly unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing. Dr. Edward Scolnick, president of the Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway, N.J., arranged the collaboration. He said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting HIV than any drug used alone. The researchers are hopeful that HIV, when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time. Therefore, several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of HIV. Currently, the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing. The new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new AIDS drugs. "An agreement like this will greatly facilitate HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 39 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way," said Scolnick. He also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws. In creating the agreement, Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy groups, including ACT-UP. Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the division on AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease said, "We're delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for AIDS."

A3; USA Today (04/20) P. 1B ================================================================== "The Next Step in AIDS Treatment" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 493 (Maddox, John) Although AZT was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with HIV, the findings do not indicate that AZT should not be administered in people with full-blown AIDS, writes columnist John Maddox. AZT has been used in the United States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of T-cell counts. However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should not be used early in the course of disease. While the CD4 counts of the 877 people given AZT were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo, the first three years of follow-up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to death were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent. The conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in HIV-infected individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to AIDS in infected people. But nothing is implied by the study of the utility of AZT in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared--there is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the evidence now available. It is much more alarming that the CD4 count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV infection. AIDS researchers should acknowledge HIV is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease. The general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes Maddox. ================================================================== "Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From HIV-1-Infected Women" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914 (Van de Perre, Philippe et al.) A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the IgM type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child, write Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 40 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda. The researchers hypothesized that transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective substances in breastmilk, or both factors. A total of 215 HIV-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum. HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were assayed by western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G. In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers (gag, pol, and env). At 15 days, 6 months, and 18 months post partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 percent of breastmilk samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; and IgM in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent. In children who survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of IgM and IgA in their mothers' milk. The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis. The combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM response was the strongest predictor of infection. IgM and IgA anti-HIV-1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of HIV, the researchers conclude. ================================================================== April 21, 1993 ================================================================== "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce (04/21/93), P. 7A A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies announced Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight HIV infection and AIDS. The companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies since realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every individual AIDS drug. Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co. Research Laboratories, led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together, said participants. In addition to Merck, the other companies involved in the Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc., Hoffman-La Roche, Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, Syntex Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau. The participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate. Scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 41 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 and early clinical data. The American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) was pleased with the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance. Related Story: Financial Times (04/21) P. 1 ================================================================== "Guidance Over HIV-Infected Health-Care Workers" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 952 (Horton, Richard) The United Kingdom's Department of Health recently followed the advice of AIDS experts that there is no scientific reason for routine HIV testing among health-care workers. Following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted HIV, the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases. Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, said doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing. He said, "Infected health care workers should not perform invasive procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to the virus." The guidelines --------- end of part 3 ------------	13
^^^^^^^^^^ The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication. A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis. If I recall correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione. When hepatic glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis. The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage. This is NOT a nice way to die. As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen. In a normal adult, this would probably cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.	13
I originally posted this to alt.suicide.holiday but it was recommended that I try you guys instead: My friend insists that Ny-Quil can be deadly if enough is taken -- he suggested something like 20-30 of the Night-time gelcaps would do someone in. Being a NORMAL user of Ny-Quil :), I checked the 'ingredients' and have a very hard time believing it. They are: 250 g acetaminophen 30 mg Pseudoephedrine HCl 10 mg Dextromethorphan HBr 6.25 mg Doxylamine Succinate (per softgel) Can someone settle our bet (a package of Ny-Quil of course :) -- what effect would 20-30 of these babies have? *-Nathan-* --	13
Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a man's vasectomy on his female partner? I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health, but what about women? For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for, say, cervical cancer? Adverse effects from sperm antibodies? Changes in the vagina's pH? Yeast or bacterial infections? Outside of study results, how about informed speculation? Thanks in advance for your help!	13
I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955. There is a story about the Civil War about a soldier who was shot in the groin. The bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby. Later, when she (a young woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her. According to this story, they lived happily ever after. Perhaps the most famous of Mr. Rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel (tapering from about 3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length). He would say, "Boys, do you know what this is? It's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's used to unclog your penis when you have VD. They just ram it up there without an anesthetic!" Needless to say this had a chilling effect. I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour. Later in life as I perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used, I could not escape thinking that I might one day see, "Reamer, Cock (style of Rau) ." ]	13
This is to followup my previous reply on this topic, which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots. 1. I stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which though sometimes true is misleading. It is not often found effective, particularly by itself. Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy. The most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this distinction becomes important. 2. I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible diagnostic marker. However, this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD. One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they are an unending source of anxiety. The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part. Some references (one non-technical and several technical) that someone was kind enough to supply for me but was unable to post themself : (technical refs) : And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to my first post on OCD. I hope this helps clarify the parts that were misleading. kind regards,	13

... There are several different types of Thyroid diseases which would cause a hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid, mainly thyroxin). Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness, and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart), changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things. I am not a doctor, so I'm sure I mistated something, but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. Get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain things in detail to you and your wife.	13
What is the healthiest way to deal with earwax? Should one just leave it in your ear and not mess with it, or should you clean it out every so often? Can cleaning it out damage your eardrums? Are there any tubes in your ear that might get blocked?	13
This request goes out to medical students who have done or are planning to sit the USMLE (or National Boards) Part 1. My wife is sitting this examination in early June this year and would like to have a look at some old National Boards, Part 1 questions found in the following books. These books are currently out of print. The books are: (1) Retired NBME Basic Medical Science Test Items, NBME; Published by NBME in 1991 (2) Self-test in the Part 1 Basic Medical Sciences, NBME; Published by NBME in 1989 I would appreciate if anyone who has these books is willing to loan it to her for a couple of days. Obviously, I would reimburse for you all postage and related charges. Failing that it would be beneficial if anyone could point to any library in the NY, NJ or PA area that may have these books. Please respond by e-mail since I do not read this newsgroup regularly. Thanks in advance. Daniel	13
EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such use). There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this). There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also binds other minerals). I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected. In animal studies, the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques). The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form. Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium. 1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review" Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974). Supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels. 2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977). The need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be overemphasized. This is a review article. 3. "Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990). Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol added to their normal food. Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.	13
I need information on the medical (including emotional :-) pros and cons of circumcision (at birth). I am especially interested in references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies that indicate advantages. A friend who is a medical student is writing a survey paper, and apparently the studies she has run into are all for circumcision, the main argument being a lower risk of penile cancer.

No wonder he became confused! With so many drugs, it is almost impossible to know which one is causing the problem. And because some drugs potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects all the worse, and even dangerous. (kinda like mixing alcohol and antihistamines!) Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving. If one drug they are taking causes the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug. This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs at home!!!!	13
-*---- I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections. I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms. (To understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection. There have been quite a few, and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.) On the other hand, I am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by suggestive clinical experience, to research it further. The doubters may be surprised. (It has happened before.) I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another. (And, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- I am the one who is currently ignorant.) But I find this the most honest route, and so I am happy with it.	13

This is true, but it's not quite the whole story. There were actually some people who were more careful in their methodology who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.' One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research named A. J. Ellison. After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of the air around the object. It's a bit more complicated than 'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited value (if any) than was previously widely thought. Electrical and magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and usually also tracer chemicals. kind regards,	13

: I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and : demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were : definitely involved. : My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the : hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate : medications. The family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling : us that none of the drugs interact. They even took the attitude that, if : he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! With : the help of an MD friend of the family, we had all his medication : discontinued. He had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug. : Two days later, he was his old self again. I guess there aren't many : medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions. I saw the same thing happen to my father, and I can more or less validate your take on hospitals. It seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine. Drugs are given as a response to symptoms (and I guess that makes sense since all the studies that validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms). But there seems to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test. I watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital. There is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue. It is really, really bizarre.	13
No, they do not work well. My doctor started using one recently, and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too. The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum. The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point the thing very carefully. This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then pushing a button. Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong. It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself. I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees, and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees. I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this, and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons. She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one's self. She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time. She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office. I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the probe immediately. This causes wrong readings. In my experience, you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement. The nurse I talked with agreed. I suspect that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason.	13
I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on. This type of loss is difficult to fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired. Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound. Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex. Nevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago. The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the difference! Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive.	13
I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was. My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint. On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast connection". But, I believe there is some truth to the book. Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction. In the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe). It is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT says "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty). At this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients. I'm glad I did this, since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole). Of course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese which all have MSG in them. It occurs naturally. I'm not going to quit eating something that I like just because it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some* people. I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting reports of what is good/bad for you. I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me. Fine. I've made my decision and I don't think it's appropriate for anyone to try to 'convert' me. "It's for your own good" are the most obnoxious and harmful words, IMO, in the English (or any other) language. I think it is. I get tired of people saying 'don't eat X because it's BAD!' Well, X may not be bad for everyone. And even if it is, so what? Give people all the information but don't ram your decisions down their throats.	13

It is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to "believe" in something like Krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects have be demonstrated to be artifacts. There is no longer any reason to adopt a "wait and see" attitude about Krilian photography, it has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal discharge. The "auras" shown by missing leaf parts came from moisture left by the original whole leaf, for example. That's what science is, son.	13

:Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver :biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months :after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have :persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of :elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times :normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. :As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. :Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at :least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of :a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with :CAH needs to be treated. I just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis. It seems that indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral, drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.). Physicians seem to have a variety of "thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone's liver. Personally, I think that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy. Others may well biopsy such a patient, thus providing these samples for study. It would be interesting to see if anyone's done any decision analysis on this.	13

Friend's unpleasant experience uring CT scan deleted I'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the hospital administrator. Specify the date and time. If possible the names of the technicians. Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was admitted. I say this because, though your friend has no argument with the doctor, I have found that administrators sometimes ignore complaints until the patient becomes litigious. Clinicians may not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find themselves named in a suit. If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter. Attach a photocopy of the original letter. Do this weekly until you do get a response. CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. The scanner can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. There was an interesting study in the BMJ, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another. This compares with 15% who said the same about a lumbar puncture.	13

Cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population. From the responses I've received to that post (all from men, by the way) I get the impression that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex. With tv programs about "boobs" (Seinfeld) and "masturbation (again Seinfeld) and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the States, I would not assume that we American's are frightened of sex. Rather we are a bit stupid about it. Healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or promiscuity. It requires responsibility.	13

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question. Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there. Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better. So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it. If you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other. In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative. And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies. But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases. There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage. Same thing. Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis. If there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about. But again, there is no point in arguing about it. There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that. Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

Recently I've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition. In particular, Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book "Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics, along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts the immune system to a significant degree. He also plugs a unique appliance called the "Colema Board", which facilitates the self-administration of colonics. It sells for over $100 from a California-based company. He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash, supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its bulkiness. If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its particulars, or the Colema Board and related products, I'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience.

BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION ) ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the FACT of "BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS" (reactions like Mg + O --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as described in the BOOK "Biological Transmutations" by Louis Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the book "THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, 1973: (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same kind. [Some kinds might work better that others.] (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number. (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks. (4) Separately incinerate both groups. (5) Weigh the residue from each group. [The residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.] (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content. [Some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..] BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our own bodies. Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly). Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro- organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc.. The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY! ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF the currently accepted "laws" of physics, (including the law which says that atomic fusion requires EXTREMELY HIGH temperatures and pressures.)

-Allergy medicine, huh? Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever, or does it actually suppress allergic reactions? (i.e. like an antihistamine does?) As far as doctors over here are concerned, if you slip up and eat something you're allergic to (even if they won't test you to tell you what to avoid) then tough; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms, then fine, otherwise you just suffer. One doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs the NHS #48 for 6 tablets) after having to rehydrate me because I'd been throwing up for four solid days and couldn't even drink water - but I got taken off it again when I moved and had to change doctors. Reasoning: they did not know what the side-effects were because it was new. OK, fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list, and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now. The only alternatives I have is to get it prescribed privately, which I cannot afford, or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid. I am fairly certain I am allergic to more than one chemical additive, as a lot of things I can't eat have nothing in common except things I know are safe, so testing myself isn't really an option; there are too many permutations.	13

Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe it is a continuum. I don't know. =================================	13
Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer? I was just wondeing, since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist. A bone scan is a nuclear scan. Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer, and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body. The tracer is usually given intravenously. (IV) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein. After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body, the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer. The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it. As far as pain, the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line. What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer. This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer, since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system. I hope I have answered some of your questions. Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care. I'm a newly graduated nurse, and I enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before. My thoughts are with you both.	13
Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus. L. acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free. Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus count. Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem. Gordon R. has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't told me which ones yet. The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina). Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina. I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms. I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body. I'm not ready to buy that yet. I do believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked. Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get rid of the problem. Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out.	13
=>Yup. The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between =>the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it. You then cut off part of =>the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph. You =>see pretty much the same image in both cases. Turns out the effect isn't =>nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between =>photographs. Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place =>conducts electricity. Surprise, surprise! = = This is true, but it's not quite the whole story. There were = actually some people who were more careful in their methodology = who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.' You can also replicate the effect with a rock: Take your first Kirlian photograph. Then moisten one edge of the rock. Lo! and behold! Phantom rock! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Carl J Lydick | INTERnet: CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI/HEPnet: SOL1::CARL	13
-*---- I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this. This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again. The bottom line is this: in normal circumstances, both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor. This means that the decision is left to the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers, at worst. As (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much. In terms of decisions you make for your child, it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little. This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision. It is not.	13
I have several isolation amplifier boards that are the ideal interface for EEG and ECG. Isolation is essential for safety when connecting line-powered equipment to electrodes on the body. These boards incorporate the Burr-Brown 3656 isolation module that currently sells for $133, plus other op amps to produce an overall voltage gain of 350-400. They are like new and guaranteed good. $20 postpaid, schematic included. Please email me for more data.	13

A friend was recently admitted to North Carolina Memorial Hospital because of suspected meningitis. Serious business. They wanted to do a lumbar puncture, for which a CT scan is a prerequisite. I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT. She was in tears. Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her. To begin with, they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself, and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine, without any explanation. Imagine this. You worried you may have a deadly disease, and next thing you know you're being put into this big scary machine, without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you. I believe this is inexcusable. She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me, and they responded with annoyance and anger. Next they inserted, or tried to insert, an IV catheter. Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain. The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation. Is there anything I can do about these pigs ? I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out. And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative. But this is simply no excuse. Their purpose for existing is to help sick people, and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior. Fortunately my friend is fine. But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all. They have cancer and that sort of thing. They don't need this kind of shit. Also, since I named the hospital involved, I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH.	13
It is evident you did not read my post carefully. I wasn't trying to tell you not to eat MSG products and produce, nor was I arguing for or against MSG. I was simply questioning the logic of your statement that simply because (a) one is not allergic to something, and (b) likes eating that it follows that one could keep eating whatever it is. In my post, I had clearly said that I don't know enough about MSG. The statement "don't eat X because its bad" is just _your_ interpretation of nutritional info out there.	13

My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome. This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it. I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions). I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia. I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology. Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months.	13

Julie, it doesn't necessarily follow that you should use it (MSG or something else for that matter) simply because you are not allergic to it. For example you might not be allergic to (animal) fats, and like their taste, yet it doesn't follow that you should be using them (regularly). MSG might have other bad (or good, I am not up on knowledge of MSG) effects on your body in the long run, maybe that's reason enough not to use it. Altho' your example of the ulcer is funny, it isn't an appropriate comparison at all.	13

That is the standard advice in dermatology texts. The soak part greatly increases the inconvenience. Don't bother unless it doesn't work otherwise. Exactly, but it adds to the "ritual" aspect, which is important for us suggestible patients. (Posters, don't bother to repeat the rationale for the soak.) Greasy no matter what. Vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is famous for that. One text states that the more greasy a dry-skin cream is, the more effective. Try USP lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy. USP lanolin is natural and much less greasy AND cheap (don't buy the more expensive perfumed lanolin mixture). As I've commented before, petrolatum is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close, even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there for months or more, and have associations with cancer. Don't panic, but also don't believe it's God's gift to the human skin.	13
A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones, a cyst on one kidney, and a kidney infection. She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall, and she has been ill all this time. During her most recent doctor's appointment at her parents' HMO clinic, she said that about FORTY! x-rays were made of her kidney. When she asked why so many x-rays were being made, she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views, but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle. She couldn't help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something. She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained. When nobody would, she got worried. Also, she is told that thre are 300! surgery patients ahead of her and that they cannot do surgery until August or so. It is now April... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids. But she has to go to classes. She wonders why they have given her no medicine. She plans to call back her doctor's office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions. But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care. She does plan to get a second opinion, too. I will pass info on to her. It never hurts to get information from more than one source. You can e-mail me or post. Thanks.	13

Hi, Thought I'd add something to the conversation. My girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens. She mentioned once about the cancerous effect of barbecued food.

You've asked a toughie of a question. There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy. The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling. Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing. Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time. Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell. Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle. The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs. In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized aagain. In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide. There are drugs which are effective in each phase. Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing. If what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff. Some side effects are pretty common. Chemo. drugs are rather nasty. It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting. Things to help this include eating small frequent meals. It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea. Diarrhea can be an effect. Antidiarrheal medications can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important. Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss. This does not always happen. It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person themself. Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects. I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp. If anyone has seen research on this too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data. I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information. In addition, if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery". It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer. They can offer some excellent support and suggestions. If you have further questions, please send me E-mail. I hav some good access to information, and I enjoy trying to help other people.	13
Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care. He was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once. Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month. Most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4. I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we are beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are, and what we can do to build up his resistance. He really enjoys his day care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny. Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions? -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections? Is there any data on home care vs. day care? -- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it not have any long term effect? -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects? -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal, and what does one do about it? -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance? Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot.	13
Insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of diphenhydramine. For most people, this does not occur. On the other hand, most people can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark. The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark. There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from sassafras products. I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which is claimed to have the saffrole removed. Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human consumption. Also, when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen bark, she made a point of telling me that I couldn't buy sassafras for human consumption. I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile live in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny, in a sick way.

Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is relevant for med students too. Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically. Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass memorization -- I am a little concerned. As I am sure most med students are. Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization? I have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things. But I have never applied them to large amounts of "data". Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or cheap software? Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques? Being an older student who returned to school this year, organization (another one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success. Please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material conceptually. I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong points. But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization.	13

The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries. I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did. ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission] "There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries" By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings is right up there. It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10. It was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called Families USA. The poll tells us that the majority of Americans believe that doctors make too much money. The pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians. Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be OK. How generous. How sporting. How stupid. Why is this poll stupid? Because it is based on resentment and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering. You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $100,000-plus and get the same results. Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks, they assume that those who do are stealing it from them. Maybe the Berlin Wall came down, but don't kid yourself. Karl Marx lives. It's also stupid because it didn't ask key questions, such as: Do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician? If those polled said no, they didn't know, then they should have been disqualified. If they gave the wrong answers, they should have been dropped. What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way: "How much should a person earn if he or she must (a) get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better, and (c) spend four more years of grinding study in medical school, with the third and fourth years in clinical training, working 80 to 100 hours a week, and (d) spend another year as a low-pay, hard-work intern, and (e) put in another three to 10 years of post-graduate training, depending on your specialty and (f) maybe wind up $100,000 in debt after medical school and (g) then work an average of 60 hours a week, with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over?" As you have probably guessed by now, I have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of Clinton and Clinton, and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake America's health care. Based on what doctors contribute to society, they are far more useful than the power-happy, ego-tripping, program-spewing, social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality. But propaganda works. And, as the stupid poll indicates, many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs. Of course doctors are well-compensated. They should be. Americans now live longer than ever. But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers, Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self-indulgent, lard-butted, TV-gaping couch cabbages. Ah, that is not something you heard President Clinton or Super Spouse talk about during the campaign or since. But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain, "Let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have. That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, you, eating too much and eating the wrong foods; many of you guzzling too much hooch; still puffing away at $2.50 a pack; getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure. "You and your habits, not the doctors, are the single biggest health problem in this country. If anything, it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do. "In fact, I don't understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day. "So as your president, I call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly. Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries. Do as I say, not as I do." But for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid, there is another solution: Don't use them. That's right. You don't feel well? Then try one of those spine poppers, needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit. Or there is the do-it-yourself approach. You have chest pains? Then sit in front of a mirror, make a slit here, a slit there, and pop in a couple of valves. You're going to have a kid? Why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have (while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way. Squat and do it. And if it survives, you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots. By the way, has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters should earn?

I don't like the term "quack" being applied to a licensed physician David. Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). I'll give you some examples. 1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication. 2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss. 3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by the NCI. These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do. There are also errors of omission(some of which result in malpractice suits). I don't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of commission or omission. Healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering. Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures, others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient. The key has to be tied to the healer's oath, "I will do no harm". But you know David that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient. The job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed. Each physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently. Some are very conservative while others are more agressive. An agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical. What do I reserve the term quack for? Pseudo-medical professionals. These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair. Some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine. But many lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a few fast bucks. While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative care area is really a buyer's beware arena. If you are lucky, you may find someone who can help you. If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo- medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the liscened physicians). I hope that this clears things up David.	13

GT> From: gary@concave.cs.wits.ac.za (Gary Taylor) GT> Hi, We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull You could do high resolution CT (computed tomographic) scanning of the skull. Many CT scanners have an algorithm to do 3-D reconstructions in any plane you want. If you did reconstructions every 2 degrees or so in all planes, you could use the resultant images to create user-controlled animation.	13
First off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind. This is sci.med, not alt.sex. Secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "American's are just too hung up on the penis....blah,blah". I think most American's don't care about anything so comlicated as that. They just think it "looks nicer". Ask a few of them and see what response you get. Others still opt for circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs. Some think it is easier to clean. Still others do it because "Daddy was". Dont' be so naive as to think American's are afraid of sexuality.	13

The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments. I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new' technology for hearing aids. The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and appears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations. The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'. This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge. This means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff). Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components. Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations.	13
Where are your references? I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium "cures diabetese". It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take. "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claim before. "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claim before. Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason. Did somebody piss you off at one time? I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person thin. But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health. It is important to exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10). Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1, 2, 3). I will not bore you with the statistics. You wouldn't believe these anyway. Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium. Chromium plays a vital role in "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose weight (4). Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6). This "protein sparing" effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue. By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin, chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they "burn" more fat and less muscle. Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the fat they've lost. Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8). Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism. In summary, you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy: A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories. - Eating fat makes you fat. B. Increase dietary fiber - low in calories; high in nutrients. C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week - burn calories. D. Take chromium picolinate daily - lose fat; keep muscle References: 1. Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

The bacteria in your gut are important. But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function. Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his/her gut. Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics. A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes. Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments". Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments(more clostly but much safer). Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients). Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket. His much higher fees do not drive away patients. I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure. For very little, if any benefit, you subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even HIV. Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment? Could they be having GI distress? Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism? Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients? Do I really want to take this risk? Food for thought.	13
We know that sermon. It is posted roughly every month or so by different persons, and that doesn't make it any better. How did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded? Why don't you consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the proper methods? Besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing one's mind to other possibilities. I you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that, instead of insulting him. Perhaps he's right. Follow your own advice, be open-minded. If you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, I'll complain that it's always those "neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever" types who narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.	13
------------- cut here ----------------- call for employers to keep information about the HIV status of health-care workers confidential. But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body. The guidelines also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health-care worker. A model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media. In addition, a U.K. advisory panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such patients. ================================================================== "Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine'" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504 (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale) The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by MicroGeneSys are advantages rather than disadvantages, write Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden, Conn. Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the HIV-1 virus does in natural infection. But vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1 specific envelope-directed immune responses, including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses. Volvovitz and Smith claim that they never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein. Antibody responses against native HIV-1 proteins, including the types described by Moore et al., exist in nearly all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 42 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 progression of HIV disease. In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The absence of CD4 binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature. Phase I studies have demonstrated stable CD4 counts, stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune function. Based on these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was chosen by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the first phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and Smith. ================================================================== "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930 (Mok, Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies, writes Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet. The anti-infective properties of milk are well documented. While the numbers of leukocytes, concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then increase from three to twelve months, with 90 percent of total IgA in milk being secretory IgA. Breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, in both normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers. The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than bottlefed infants (9.7 months). Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS. There is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection. Studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens. Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor. In the developing world, where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality, breast milk is still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status. Transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded. The possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok. ================================================================== "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269, No. 14, P. 1802 (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.) If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M. Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 43 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 et al. of the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami, Fla. The researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing. Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their HIV to that of the dentist. Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail. There were 1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124 were deceased. An examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of whom were either homosexuals or IV-drug users. The researchers were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1,048 patients, and 900 agreed to be tested. HIV infection was reported in five of the 900 patients, including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease. One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior. Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related. The study suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson et al. ================================================================ April 22, 1993 ================================================================ "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington Post (04/22/93), P. A13 Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once, which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again. But a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new TB infection, doctors found. Peter M. Small of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the study, said that in order to protect against reinfection, it may be necessary for some people to use TB medicines permanently. The study examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how the germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County Hospital in New York. ================================================================ "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 930 (Mok, Jacqueline) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies, writes Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and AZT lead to AIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives." However, their hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not attained any public health benefits. The U.S. government spends $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, no prevention, and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this hypothesis. Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from Vancouver. However, their survey neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug- AIDS hypothesis, because it does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free AIDS cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether. To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years HIV-positive patients who use recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as positives who do not do so. The 10 year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS. Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg. ================================================================ "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1 Infection" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959 (Vento, Sandro et al.) Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful "autoimmune" reactions, write Sandro Vento et al. of the A. Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy. The researchers report three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with hepatitis C Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid, profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN. All three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum HIV p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24. Sera from all three patients, obtained at the end of IFN treatment and testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II antigens, homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of HIV-1 gp41. These autoantibodies, which also recognize "native" class II molecules and may contribute to the elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires (50-100) in all three patients six months after stopping IFN. Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV infection and HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not experience CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful "autoimmune" reactions. The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell counts and clinical progression of HIV-1 disease. IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. ================================================================ April 23, 1993 ================================================================ "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6 (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the United States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS patients, immigrants, minorities, and prisoners. Dr. Lee B. Reichman, professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey Medical School and president of the American Lung Association, said, "Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's everyone's problem." The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans are infected with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed, especially those with AIDS or HIV. Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 46 Volume 6, Number 11 April 25, 1993 Tammes, a Centers for Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS with TB patients. State health officials believe the TB is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment. In addition, the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services. In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control. According to Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in treatment. About 40 percent of infected New York City residents don't complete therapy. When TB patients don't finish taking their medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat. ================================================================ "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in Southern Florida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. 83, No. 4, P. 571 (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of risk, write Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga. The researchers investigated 168 such AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach counties. All of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of HIV transmission. Medical records of patients, in addition to records from social services, HIV counseling and testing centers, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics were reviewed. If no other HIV risk factor was found from medical record review, patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. Once STD clinic and other medical records were reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into other HIV transmission categories. After adjustments were made for the reclassification, the percentage of AIDS cases reported from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33 percent to 28 percent among women. While the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it still remained above the national average, the researchers conclude.

THE diarrhea problem? WHAT diarrhea problem? First, candidal overgrowth is not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida. But a case of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going to surprise anyone either. That's not what people are disagreeing with. Oh, really? Where'd you come up with this? You know, it's really appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature. Bobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine. I hope you're not giving the wrong idea to your medical students.	13
Hmm. This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack. There are unethical behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees) which I would not lable as quackish, but prescribing known ineffective therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack.	13
For a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning. My sleep latency at night is also pretty long, ranging from 30 min to an hour. I get about 7 hours of bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends. I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can, because I feel so tired when I wake up, even more tired than I was when I went to bed, which is usually too tired to work. Anyway, I recently had a really bad flu, so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant. So I used that anyway, and the three nights I used it, I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is, I actually felt refreshed the next morning. So, I am now trying to look into, both in the literature and experimentally, the use of antihistamines as sleep aids, since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect. The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate, so I bought some generic tablets of that, and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement. I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect. Also, library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC. So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that; the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try. For other medical information, I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico. I also have chronically dry eyes, which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants. I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia, so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that, and it didn't help, so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse, also taking vitamin supplements)	13
-*---- Sci.med removed from followups. (And I do not read any of the other newsgroups.) -*---- That's fine. These words have multiple meanings. As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no reason for me to believe in these. I usually use the word agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of a god is unknown inherently unknowable. Note that this is a positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a god; I do not believe in a god, but I also do not believe the agnostic claim.	13
But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start to have a paradoxical effect? I used to take one every night for allergies and couldn't figure out why I developed bad insomnia. Finally figured out it was the antihistamines. I would fall asleep for a few minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not get back to sleep. I don't have that problem since I stopped the antihistamines at bedtime. ?	13

I am quite near sighted. I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well. My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour. The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment. I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments. The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most interest to me: If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action? If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards. Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm. Many thanks Bill	13

Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6. I can't seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe limits. I looked at a "Balanced 100" time release formulation from Walgreen's and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA. Is this safe?!?. Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for? Mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net.	13
Could anyone give me information on Umbilical hernias. The patient is over weight and has a protruding hernia. Surgery may be risky due to the obesity. What other remedies could I try? Thanx in advance	13

Depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components. I noticed that I became depressed in various buildings, and at home when the air conditioning was on. Subsequent testing revealed that I was allergic to stemphyllium, a mold commonly found in air conditioners. After I began taking antigens, that problem disappeared.	13

To: turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin) RT> o Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects RT> receive a placebo or the test treatment. It seems to me that many drugs have such severe side effects that it might not be possible to keep the doctors from knowing who is getting the true drug. This is especially true of the drugs used for "mental" illnesses.	13
Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the young. Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to bottle feedings, but rather eliminate foods from mother's diet. Your pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid.	13

Unless the patient has a very short life expectancy, the possible complications from a hernia that hasn't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery. The risks of surgery, anyway, are minimal. Unless they are exceedingly large, hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia. Don't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction. And the smaller the hernia is, the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will become incarcerated or strangulated. ===============================	13
Well, that post was not that accurate. People with early life hernias are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias. The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining. However, the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is high enough that it ought to be repaired. The risk of cancer is probably no higher than the general population, but since you are near 40, it would be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening, such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Sorry for the misleading info.	13
This question derives from the Waco incident: Could CS ("gas") particles create an allergic response which would result in laryngospasm and asphyxiation?- especially in children.	13
Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this: I APOLOGIZE for my flame. First, because I distributed the message to so many newsgroups; I did not check the crosspostings of the article I followed up on. Second, for not making my argument clear enough. I reacted to the tone of many of the anti-Kirlian posts, not to their content. Right or wrong, I found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words (that includes "jokes"), which I still think is unwarranted. And, obviously, I should not have done the same.	13
This is not flame, or abuse, nor do I want to start another thread (this is, after all, supposed to be about IMAGE PROCESSING).	13
Ron, you are absolutely right. Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate. But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate. Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle. I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably always will be. If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that you will be wrong. As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?). On the kidney stone problem. I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab. Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium. I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body. I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful(I agree). If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals, I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine.	13
I've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery, and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme. Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular or joint problems. But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique. In the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage" in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines! The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes. By this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.	13
[...] And presumably this is a matter of degree; it must be common to prescribe a drug that has _some_ chance of giving _some_ benefit, but not a high probability of it, and/or not a large benefit. Right?	13
For one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. If it changes anything. You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked). Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's hard to digest anyway. For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it will put pressure on the digestive tract. Try laying on your sides, back, and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby "turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous. Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young. But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible. Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble. Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) Good luck	13
Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this. There are non-surgical ways, however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this. The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery, though. About asthma, that's a little more controversial. Dr. Ivker, in his book, "Sinus Survival", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage (postnasal drip) from the sinuses. He's had many patients who've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation. Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery, as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis. Jon Noring -- Charter Member --->>> INFJ Club.	13
[Partial deletion] Nice explanation except that it isn't N-hydroxylation that causes the formation of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), but rather a direct two-electron oxidation. In addition, there is one school of thought that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen. As far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one of the most intensely scrutinized. An excellent recent review of the topic can be found in: Vermeulen, Bessems and Van de Straat. Molecular Aspects of Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its Mechanism-Based Prevention. Drug Metabolism Reviews, 24(3) 367- 407 (1992). (Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe) I couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic dose of acetaminophen causes. I've heard a number of descriptions by physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a lingering very painful death.	13

Hi sci.med folks... I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium. I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife. She has been having difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion. I would like to know whatever is important that I should know. I worry about this sort of thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy. I have a booklet from the "Lithium Information Center" based at the University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be interested in comments from the "not necessarily PRO" side of the fence. I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed... Thanks for any information you can provide. Please email me directly...	13
As a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful sting, but it quickly subsided. Much less painful compared to a bee sting. Centipedes have a poison claw (one of the front feet) to stun their prey, but in my single experience it did not have a lot of "bite" to it.	13
Chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. The degree of elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with CAH needs to be treated. ======================================	13
To Whomever who can help me, I am a doctor from Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia. I have recently hooked up my private home computer to EMail via the local telephone company. I am really interested in corresponding with other Doctors or medical researchers through Email. I also hope to be able to subscribe to a news network on medicine. Can someone please tell me what I should do? I am completely new to this and have no idea about the vast capabilities of Email.	13
I heard a great Civil War story... A guy on the battlfield is shot in the groin, the bullet continues on it's path, and lodges in the abdomen of a female spectator. Lo and behold.... As the legend goes, both parents survived, married, and raised the child.	13

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ****** Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu> Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC Date: Thursday April 15, 1993 ATLANTA (UPI) -- A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system, federal health officials said Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases. Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled "Emerging Infectious Diseases" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community. The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments. "This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it," said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases. There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic, the first in this century, she said. Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. "We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past" Berkleman said. She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment. "Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States," the CDC said. It cited the emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome. "The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas," the CDC said. It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance. =====*===== SOURCE: WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1 HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability. A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property. The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical expenses and lost wages. Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L. Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable. Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant. But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one. The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease. Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and lost earnings. The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease. Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn & Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease." Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten. The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites. A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites. Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease. And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes. Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical- supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected. Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide. =====*===== TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease. AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH, Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30 Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae. We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2. Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient. We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract. In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy. Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted. Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common. Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended.

No doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers. I'm rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic/scientific journals. So, the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that. Also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the GI tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too. Then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even though he, like Linus Pauling, is lucid and robust well into his nineties--but nevermind about that. He shouldn't charge for his equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the FDA. Of course, with FDA approval an MD or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as thalidomide. But nevermind about that either. Unfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of Net.Medical. Discussion without a credential and without understanding that the righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced before dismissing you as a fool. But maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable responses by e-mail. 1/2 ;^) 1/2 ;^( Oh yes, I did have a point. A few years ago an MD with a thriving practice in a very wealthy part of Silicon Valley once recommended that I take such treatments to clear up a skin condition. (Not through his office, I might add.) Although I'm sure that's not conclusive, it was sure an unusual prescription!	13

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for decades. Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep aids as Sominex, Nytol, etc. The active ingredient is: diphenhydramine, the same antihistamine that's in Benadryl. -- Steven Litvintchouk MITRE Corporation 202 Burlington Road Bedford, MA 01730-1420	13
I posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity". I now think it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of electricity. It is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful. Another thing. When you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed. Then you relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh. So, you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat). Then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you hear loudens. (Note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.) This roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your body. "Shiver" is not the word. It may be called a mild vibration or quake. What is this shiver and roam? Can I use this to induce out-of-body experience?	13
As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist. All doctors are "qualified" to read x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing else, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of practice). If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by this technique. - Paul.	13
: My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. She says that because she has no : medical insurance, she cannot get them removed. : : My question: Is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least mitigate : their effects? Any help is deeply appreciated. (Advice, referral to literature, : etc...) : : Thank you, : : Dave Carvell : pk115050@wvnvms.wvnet.edu First off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones several years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes, by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in. --	13
I've had neither a baby nor a kidney stone, but according to my aunt, who has had plenty of both, a kidney stone is worse.	13
I'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can I take at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but preferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer? I'm thinking mainly of OTC products. Which has the least duration of sedative action: Benadryl, Chlor-Trimeton, or what? Note that I'm asking about duration, not intensity.	13
You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine, hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) ) [Riga IN. Rev d'Oto-Neuro-Ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms [Jackson RT. Annals of Otology 1976;85:65-70 Cvetnic MH, Cvetnic V. Rhinology 1980;18:47-50 Cottle MH. Rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate oral intake and electrolyte imbalance [Fairbanks DNF. Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery 1986;94:412-415). So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a MEDLINE search on the topic say back to 1966. There's been extensive literature on this for over a 100 years. I may be in cardiology but I've had a very good working relationship with my colleagues from ENT.	13
Hi all, My skin is very dry in general. But the most serious part is located from knees down. The skin there looks like segmented. The segmentation actually happens beneath the skin. I would like to know if there is any cure for this. At the supermarkets or pharmacies, there are quite a lot of stuffs for dry skins, but what to chose? Thanks in advance for all advices and hints.

Three possible results after interview: 1) rejection outright 2) acceptance outright 3) the infamous 'wait list'... If you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their acceptance. This can happen as late as day -1 of starting classes. You can always call the admissions office. The secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application. Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries have more power than you might realize, and you never know- could be the dean of admissions answering the phone. If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular accomplishments. Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor. I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted. Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other. If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you can improve your application. A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face. Also, don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no, sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'. I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point. Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you say it. Review your academic accomplishments. If your grades are poor in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework. Evidence of determined committment will help here. If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses, it usually shows. Look at your extracurricular involvements. Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out. Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in applying to any program, medical or what-have-you. Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting is the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)	13
=>Greg:Flame definitely intended here. Bill was making fun of the misspelling. =>Go look up the word "krill." Also, the correct spelling is Kirlian. It =>involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the =>subject to a high-voltage source, not of some "aura." It works equally well =>with inanimate objects. = =True.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf? Is this ="corona discharge"? Yup. The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between the plates, and taking a Kirlian photograph of it. You then cut off part of the leaf, put the top plate back on, and take another Kirlian photograph. You see pretty much the same image in both cases. Turns out the effect isn't nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between photographs. Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place conducts electricity.

Umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a "licensed physician" being called a quack? Or is it just that being a licensed physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the physician agrees with your system of beliefs? Actually, I almost never use the term quack. When I discuss "systemic yeast syndrome", however, I always point out that mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and I agree with that characterization). Really? I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what Steve Dyer, Gordon Banks, and I am implying when we have talked about systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis. Would you prefer the word "charlatan"? (I don't happen to think that all quacks are charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the "diseases" they are diagnosing.) Why? Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome?	13
Nonsense! I've taught fifth, sixth, seventh . There are a few early puberty types in fifth and it has nothing to do with early sexual experience.	13
I saw this a few years ago on "Tomorrow's World" (low-brow BBC technology news program). The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned. High intensity pressure waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct). These waves are focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to break up. This is completely painless. Of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through the urethra. Ouch! Paul.	13
day. Recently, I completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had two colonics as part of it. My motivation was primarily spiritual, to de-toxify from all the crap I've been putting in my body (not like thats enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect). Personaly, I didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about 15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and feel great. One of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from years of indulgence. Not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly I don't mind giving my body a hand once in a while. Just my experience, George Paap	13
FLAME ON Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling) photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the narrow-minded, "I know it all", "I don't believe what I can't see or measure" attitude of many people out there. I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis. I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists, were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics. Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not drop off the edge of the earth. FLAME OFF, or end sermon :-)	13
First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat, not humans. Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol. This is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation. Put in layman's terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be turned into heat. 2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction. In controlled amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available. It is very dangerous. It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than play around with 2,4-DNP.	13
There are two different mechanisms here: toning of muscles and reduction of fat. Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers). However, if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body. There is no way to "spot reduce" body fat other than surgically, through liposuction. Distribution of body fat is genetically determined. Sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like "fat", so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may *appear* as though the "fat" is "changing" into "muscle", but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate, and one does not ever "change into" the other.	13
I was told by my doctor I've had three children and the pain was different in degree for each. I think it just depends. I was impressed by how awful a kidney stone seemed to be, when I saw a relative with one. I bet they depend, too--some are probably worse than others. Pain--yucch.	13
These are MY last words on the subject Some people think it enhances the flavor. I personally don't think it helps the taste, it makes me sick, so I try to avoid it. Well, I know that MSG effects ME adversely - maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that I like to try to avoid the stuff. EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!! Why can't people learn to cook from scratch *ON* the net. I've gotten LOTS of recipes off the net that don't use additives. If you LIKE additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket, buy lots of packaged foods, and YOU get OFF THE NET!! I don't!! HEY - I'll pay *MY* hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does NOT have preservatives. I choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways. Nacho cheese Doritos, breading for MANY frozen fried foods (like fish and chicken), etc. ad naseum. Or the "and other natural flavorings syndrome." It's been a few years since I've bought anything labelled with "and other natural flavorings". Well, I had had similar reactions many times. That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing. UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my Seldane. And did I ever learn to read labels. Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick. And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so I can either throw it out or give it away.) Probably Lawry's seasoning salt. I LOVE the way that tastes. I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG. I've noticed that I have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants the day before. But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%. How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem? Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick. Also - I'm sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times. If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ chips ;}). Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it "chinese restaurant syndrome" and I NEVER stated I got it only from Chinese food. I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or not hold) the MSG. I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them to make me ONE back of chips without MSG. Well, I believe I mentioned that in an earlier post Let's see you wrote this message at Date: 20 Apr 1993 00:09:31 -0500 but on Date: 19 Apr 1993 16:33:18 GMT OH - and just in case anyone thinks I'm prejudice against either Chinese food or Asian people - I'm not going home to cook some Chinese food for the guy I'm marrying next week. Incidentally, his last name is Wu.

SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA, Bosnia, Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August. But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon. ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.'' Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there. ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters. Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections. He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated 4,000 patients. He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said. His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children. The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said. ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.'' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine. The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.'' Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies. ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding. ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types. ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said. The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres. But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.'' Then the hunger set in. Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said. ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said. According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege. Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is ill in Tuzla. ``They say I'm a hero,'' he said. ``There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road, crying and waving when I left. And I cried too.''	13

The burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this "syndrome". To date, these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data. Hopefully, as a scientist, you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data. Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than "Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ...". Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis, but rarely proves anything in a positive sense. And unlike mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease. I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather 'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'. I have no problem with such an approach; but this is NOT what is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.	13

I'm a nursing student, and I would like to respond to #66966 on haldol and the elderly. Message-ID: <25APR199316225142@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu> Organization: Florida State University - School of Higher Thought News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1 First, I'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this. I know it has to have been tough. There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults. The change in environment can cause problems. Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of the body as easily. In addition, medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion. As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued, I do not know. I have not _seen_ anything to that effect. However, I also had not been looking for that information. I can see what I can find... I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook, it is "Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia" (p. 400). It also should not be discontinued abruptly. It did not say anything about long lasting effects. Because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time; if I had more history, i might be able to answer you better. If you want to send me e-mail with more information, I would be happy to try to help you piece together what might have happened.	13
There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss. The few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it). Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium will increase muscle mass and decrease fat. Of course, chromium is also used t o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just as well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-) On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic... -Paul ---------------------------------------------------------- | Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.

Assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping in the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a bulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or may even make things worse. (My wife would disagree, she does it successfully every six months or so.) In any case DO NOT ATTEMPT ANYTHING WITH Q-TIPS!!! My experience has been that this is initially best handled by a Ear/Nose/Throat person. I say initially, because an ENT can evaluate whether or not you might have success on your own with a little instruction. I am not a physician (obviously, because I eschew the term otolaryngologist); this posting is based only on personal experience. ======================================================================== <Usual Disclaimer> "The best is the enemy of the good" - Voltaire Leon Traister (lmtra@amdahl.uts.amdahl.com)	13
[reply to roxannen@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.u] I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, where the consensus was that sumatriptan (Imitrex) has no advantages over DHE-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30). Besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal spray works? DHE nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.	13
I don't know if it causes the body any harm, but in the 23 years I've been teaching nine and ten years olds I've never had one fall over from eating "boogers" which many kids do on a regular basis [when they think no one is looking . . .]	13
:When I was a school boy, my biology teacher told us of an incident :in which a couple were very passionate without actually having :sexual intercourse. Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm :cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation. : :Was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually :occur? Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg. There is only one way for pregnancy to occur: intercourse. These days however there is also artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of "natural" acts here. It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is deposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus), but that's about at far as you can get. Through clothes -- no way. Better go talk to your biology teacher.	13
Robert, I'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion. I've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med. I didn't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just like I haven't read "The Yeast Connection"). Let me just start by stating that the authors of the "Cold Fusion" papers of recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually left the country). Scientific fraud is rare. I'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation. Your sources do not seem to be research articles. They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food combining and life extension texts). Robert, I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body). Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before). Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash. Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue. I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher. The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce *only* a mineral ash. They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and in our soil. Are these fusion reactions? Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics. Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon? Not in my book Robert. Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet. I've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form. I like reading science fiction, as many people do. But I know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to separate the fiction from the fact. Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans. We have several grams of the stuff in our body. What's it doing there? Only the Lord knows right now. But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium). Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue(collagen and elastin). There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans). For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts. A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation. This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone. A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing. Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing. And so is silicon(in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium). For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick. But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and yes even some scientific papers). Is the explanation reasonable? Without a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any better). If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion). If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up. If this makes us kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label. For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV. I can't remember the network or his name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup). This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words). He says that he has a 70% success rate. The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional treatment). He was going to go in and cut. You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals. What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys? I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments? Treatments which do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?). Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are? How about quality of life guys? May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).	13
Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly? Does short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after the use of the drug? My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks. Although the drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance. It seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the course of just one and one-half months. I have to believe that the combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part catalysts for this. Any comments?	13
One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical literature to keep up with changes in medical practice. All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against cancer. A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack. Anti-fungals are in a different class. The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics? Gorden Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body. I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice. He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this. I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida. Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams. Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use. The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom. The arguement is that without proof, no action is warrented. Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way. There has always been the use of conventional wisdom. A very good example is kidney stones. Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming. Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed. Through the recent New England J of Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake. The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans David? We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider yogurt dangerous). If this were a standard part of medical practice, as Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline.	13

A good source of information on Burzynski's method is in *The Cancer Industry* by pulitzer-prize nominee Ralph Moss. Interesting. What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination? None of the flyers for his books mention this, and none of the Cancer Chronicle Newsletters that I have mention this either. Also, a non-profit organization called "People Against Cancer," which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the cancer industry, but which have shown highly promising results (all of which are non-toxic). Moss is People Against Cancer's Director of Communications. People Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information, not exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to. Most (maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, and many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well. sdb	13
Dear Netters: Maybe one of you can explain this. From time to time I experience a strange kind of feeling (I have all kinds of weird feelings) which can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one experiences in a descending elevator. Needless to say, it is not enjoyable. It sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme fatigue. It lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts that long, it makes me sweatening. Initially I called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until I later learnt that the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats. So, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am I a stragne person? I always believe I am unique. Thanks.	13
Precisely. One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that could be causing "difficulty with his behavior". Standard practice would be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.

Sounds pretty familiar. I posted similar cries about last September when Caroline just entered daycare. She was two, then, and have been with continuous colds since until last March. As spring approaches, her colds slowed down. Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics. (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.) There are the 'net studies' -- that is, if you read this newsgroup often, there will be a round of questions like this every month. There might be formal studies like that, but bear with my not so academic experience. Okay? Gee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories. I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less. But, that child still will face the world one day. That's what I believe and comfort myself with. Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same. Cold virus mutate easily. However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases, so she would be less severely affected. Everytime she has a cold, we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). That's about all the care she needs from us. I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics. Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics. I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off. I do understand that you don't have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever. If the child doesn't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime, then the child should be stronger. I'll leave this to expert. If your child just entered daycare, I'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be the hardest. (Then, you get more used to it. Boy, do I hate to see me typing this sentence. I recall when I read something like this last September, I said to myself, 'oh, sure.' But, I do get used to it, now.) However, I do hear people say that it does get better after a year or two. I am looking forward to a healthier next winter. As it gets warmer, I hope you do get some break soon. Eat well, sleep well. Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary. Good luck.

Need info on Circumcision, medical cons and pros I'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population. Since your friend is not a man, she can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin.

About two years ago I posted the following: I am planning to write a new book called "Great Canadian Scientists." Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists. About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting. I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible. Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist. After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies. If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear them.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but became Americans after graduate school. Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again. If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop me a line. ================================================== That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12", So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well. I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it. Hope to find one soon. I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed. I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "Canadian" and what is "scientist".

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum, but it might be possible. So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant. Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is, of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.	13
<: ....other good stuff about the Drs idiocy Ok, much as I hate to do it, here I am posting an EVEN BETTER "Dr. Idiot" story. I was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was exhausted. My OB and I decided to go for a csec. The OB called in the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery. AFTER, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as I like to refer to him) said, "Well, I am off duty now." (still staring between my legs at that). The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty. The anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes. In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes. had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call. It was the only time during my labor that I swore. The on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get there. Come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there. Good thing for all of us (especially him) that it was not a critical emergency. But boy would I love to knock that fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a few little minutes. I have run into "Dr. Idiots", "Mechanic Idiots", "Clerk Idiots" and "Etc. Idiots" in my time, but this fellow I would like to have words with.	13
I use a ZYGON Mind Machine as bought in the USA last year. Although it's no wonder cure for what ail's you. It is however VERY good at stopping you thinking! Sound strange? Well suppose you're tired and want to go to bed/sleep. BUT your head is full of niggling problems to resolve, you lay in the bed, and quickly they all come to the surface, churning around from one unresolved thing to the next and then back again. Been there, bought the t-shirt? I slip on the Zygon and select a soothing pattern of light & sound, and quickly I just can't concentrate on the previous stuff. Your brain's cache kinda get's flushed, and you start on a whole new set of stuff. A useful addition, is the facility to feed the output of a tape player or CD through the box, I use New Age elevator muzak to enhance the overall effect. DEFFO better than a pill. Cheers Nigel	13

I've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the greater volume. My Internist, who diagnosed my AV block, slow heart rate and PVC's, told me something different. She says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its size. Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the effects are unrelated except for their common source. The AV block, she asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued. PVC's are also common in runners. So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients. Isn't that strange, though? Are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete's heart? Is it all good?	13
My girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes. It really helped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics. She doesn't have a mail account, but asked me to forward this: "Glaxo is the distributor; Imitrex is the drug's brand name. It works. She can call her pharmacy for more info. The "miracle" drug has been used for years in Europe and for some time in Canada. Trials in the U.S. were completed and the drug hit the US market at the end of March. Some pharmacies don't stock it yet. Presently it needs to be injected subcutaneously; although testing is starting with a nasal spray form. It mimics serotonin (its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors looks identical to serotonin on a model I saw)"	13

About six years ago my ears clogged up with wax, probably as a result of to much headphone use. Anyway, the clinic that cleaned them out used the following procedure: 1. Inject olive oil into ears. 2. Prevent leakage of oil with cotton. 3. Come back in an hour. 4. Rinse ears with warm vater, forcefully injected into ear (very strange sensation). 5. Done. They had special tools to do this, and were evidently quite familiar with the problem: Very large steel syringe. Special bowl with cutout for ear to take the grime coming out without spillage.

Here is a press release from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces; AFSCME, Other Unions Commemorate Workers Memorial Day To: National Desk, Labor Writer Contact: Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130 WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job. This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville, Ohio. The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years. On Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994. The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff. Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain high. In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff, compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991. The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing. For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3. Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards. AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's federal, state and local correctional facilities. Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions. Every year, 10,000 American workers die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease. Public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include: -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are not barricaded or don't have proper lighting. -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector employer and nursing homes ranked fifth. There were more than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the previous year. It is generally believed that health care workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses than do their private sector counterparts. Health and safety issues facing health care workers include exposure to tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high levels of stress. -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health institutions are often the victims of assaults and, sometimes, fatal attacks. For instance, last October, a man carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y. and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the gun on himself. There are two basic problems. First is a growing lack of support services for people who don't have the help they need. Because workers are overworked, some clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling. Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated. The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent, as more are moved out of the institutions. Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed. Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees. "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees," said McEntee. "This, despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers, corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society. This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces. We need the public support to be successful." Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe. Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage. -30-	13

There's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping mall, offering free examinations. Part of the process involves a multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer- sounding voice "digitize left PSIS" "digitize right PSIS" "digitize C7" "please stand with spine in neutral position". I'm wondering whether this doesn't really measure anything and the computer voice is to impress the victims, or whether it is measuring something that chiropractors think is useful to measure. -- haynes@cats.ucsc.edu haynes@cats.bitnet	13

Secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 Cdn for a tube), and is indeed an over the counter medication. Why it does not appear to be available in the US, I don't know. It's manufactured in Montreal. It's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from dry mucous membranes. From some of the replies to my original posting, it's evident that some people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected from environmental influences (ie, dry air). But I've had no responses from anyone with experience with Rutin. Is there another newsgroup that might have specifics on herbal remedies? But thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences.	13

In <faUk03m6d0Kq00@amdahl.uts.amdahl.com>, dated 29 Apr 93 15:43:10 GMT, I'll agree with your wife. While I was a student, I had doctors remove rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple times, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and said something like "Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there". In my case, removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months. You can buy little bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store - I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.	13

I'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better. I applied to about 20 schools, got two interviews, got one offer, and am waiting to hear from the other school. Let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process. Numbers (GPA, MCATs) are not everything, but they are probably more important than anything else. In fact, some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities. Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee. But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically. You mentioned one response, was it an acceptance, denial, or wait-list? If I assume the worst, that it was a denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere. How did your interviews go? As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything. Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial. Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June. But some schools are still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry. Don't become fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself. What do people think of the medical school admissions process? I had a very mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software engineer for two years. I majored in Computer Science at Stanford. Still, I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this: VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA: 3.5 or better MCAT: top 15% in all subject MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know Anyway, you are in good shape. I think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers, but would like very much to understand each person as an individual. Sometimes thats just not practical. But getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers. Hopefully, you were able to impress them with your character.	13
When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower. Some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality(mumps, measles. etc.). Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care. Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity. But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production). In addition, antibody levels tend to decline with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children. Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body. Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support). Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my opinion). But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases. I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity. Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection. A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection. There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents. They are: protein, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron and zinc. The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem. But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune response. Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A). There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection. Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status. I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in. I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response. You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist. Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull. You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's what you need to look for. Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests. They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however.	13

Without restating the thread going here..... Zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant. It is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error, but if it is any help, there are a lot of people using the side effects of the many medications to help manage other conditions.

Mark, this is the most reasonable post that I've seen in Sci. Med. on the topic of Colonic Flushing. I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases. Proving that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in pointing out). The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their techingues work. The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just the woman's preception of improvement). This study was hailed by the JAOA editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove itself to the medical community. I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support nutrition education and research. I've pointed out, in a grant proposal, that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs during his service in the Civil War). He decided that there had to be a better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being worse than the disease. Through his many years of study of the human body, he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school. We now have 17. Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he used diet to prevent human disease. I'm trying to get the Osteopathic Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to speak). Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have very little understanding of how diet affects human health. This has to change.

I've tried it, and so has one friend of mine. No known side effects or risks. It didn't seem to work for us, but several studies now have suggested it does work for many people, so I think it's worth a try. You can find it in capsule form at health food stores. Up to six capsules a day was recommended, if I remember correctly. It can also be prepared as a tea. Good luck,	13
A placebo is an accepted treatment at times. Why should it? Placebos are effective under certain circumstances. That's why they're used. Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a "sugar pill". I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the name. It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just not for what you have. Antibiotics for viral infections are the most common such placebo. I'm not sure what you mean by this. What do you think you're paying for? You're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a doctor's appointment. --	13
I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no anxiety or jitters. I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit. Maybe because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a 20mg dose didn't work. Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin reuptake inhibitor like Prozac). One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. Now I'm trying 100mg/day. Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than Prozac. I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft have to discontinue it because of side effects. The only problem I'm having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying. Hopefully the Zoloft will work. Maybe your friend should try this one next. My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin drugs, usually Prozac. If that works, great. If it works but has too many side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil. If the serotonin drugs don't work at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine. Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big difference. My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe him. I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my family practitioner's office. Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor; what I know about this comes from talking to my psychiatrist and reading sci.med.	13
Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read "The Yeast Connection". So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this "hated" book. It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter. The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present. Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis." Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection. Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute it. What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic infection. These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity). Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms. Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections". I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better). The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure". I guess that your nutrition course does not, too bad. My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you? If you noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's). But, as you point out, it displays dimorphism. It is capable of producing yeast cells, pseudohyphae and true hyphae. Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you. To a biochemist, it's a lot of Greek. So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me. You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in Sci. Med. And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I've said, that it will make sense.

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't any medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain. Either they pass, or they have to be broken up with sound, or they have to be extracted surgically. When I was in, the X-ray tech happened to mention that she'd had kidney stones and children, and the childbirth hurt less.	13
-*---- The millipede's around here (Austin) have no sting. Some of the centipedes do. The question Rebecca Snyder asks is much like asking "How venomous are snakes?" One either wants to ask "which snake?" or point to some reference on the many different species of snake. Similarly, there are many different species of millipede and centipede. (These are different families; millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while centipedes have but one pair.) Sorry if this information is not useful.	13
I have seen Copper Bracelet by the name of Sabona created by Dr. John Sorenson. I am looking for literature on the effectiveness of Copper Bracelet in dealing with Arthritis. I know in one case a 70-year old person developed bruise at the base of her left thumb after wearing the copper bracelet on her left wrist for several months. She was told the bruise is "normal" and would disappear. Is the bruise reason to be concerned? Should the person discontinued wearing the copper bracelet? Could anyone kindly point me to literature on copper bracelet? What are the other information on copper bracelet? Your response would be very much appreciated. Thank you. Lau Hon-Wah	13
Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine: candida can cause mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients, systemic candida infection. I think "The Yeast Connection" is a bunch of hooey. What does this have to do with how well nutrition is taught, anyway? Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the mold form. Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, depending on environment. Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment. Should we maybe call it a mold infection? a fungus infection? Maybe we should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.	13

Steve Bellovin writes a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive article about why the Clipper (are we still calling it Clipper today, or have they figured out a non-infringing word yet?) protocol is almost as good as one can do given their marching ordes. I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument. In my view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is secret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door. Without complete disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted experts are allowed to look at it in isolation. Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm? The only concern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build Clipperphones without registering the keys. Assume F can really be kept secret as the Government assumes. Then as part of the initial connection, a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know F. For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q and sends E[Q; F]. The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator sends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a random 64-bit block. Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial numbers of subsequent challenges. This way Clipperphones will talk only to other Clipperphones. Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own proprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow. What's wrong with this picture? It depends of F staying secret and on Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears to believe in both of these. Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some flaw, I imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't. Agreed. My view, and you can quote me: if it's not worth doing, it's not worth doing well.	11
The Attorney General publishes the number of court-ordered taps each year. It isn't enough (around a thousand) for the average non-crook, non-spy to worry about. In fact, considering any reasonable guess about the number of big-time crooks and spies around, it may not be enough even for most crooks and spies to worry about. There's no reason to believe that it will go up with Clipper, since the number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based on the playbacks we've heard in court cases).

I've recently been reading a paper of Merkle's (publixhed only on the net, I think) discussing three potential replacements for DES. Was anyting ever done with these? Are Khufu, Khafre, and/or Snefru still being discussed anywhere? (I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA FAQ, and I think it may also be in the sci.crypt FAQ.) On a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find papers/articles/discussions of cryptology? I think I've about exhausted the Math/Sci library here, which doesn't seem to have anything more recent than about '84. Thanks.	11
Brad Yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a phone-clipper relationship. It doesn't wash. Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone calls. They do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap. They then record the stuff. If it's Clipper, they read the law enforcement block, extract the serial number, and get the keys using the court order. No new difficulties (such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone line) are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper. If the crooks were going to use a pay phone (say), they could have done so without clipper. If the government figures out they're so doing, they listen in, and if it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys. If the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line there's no problem. The Feds don't care whose phone instrument is used, just that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. They get the serial number, get the keys, and they are in business. No clipper chip to person association is ever needed. David	11

Hello all, I thought you all might like to see this. It's a letter from Jerry Berman to David Chaum from November of 1985, in response to information that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman. While I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the Clipper Chip announcement from the White House, I think it's important to recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director, as explained below. I agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire. Mr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net. I don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar organizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things. --Aristophanes ---------- AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION WASHINGTON OFFICE 122 Maryland Avenue, NE November 1, 1985 Washington, DC 20002 -------------------- National Headquarters Mr. David Chaum 132 West 43rd Street Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science New York. NY 10036 P.O. Box 4079 (212) 944-9800 19O9 AB Amsterdam Norman Dorsen President Dear Mr. Chaum: Ira Glasser Executive Director Eleanor Holmes Norton CHAIR National Advisory Council Thank you for sending me a most interesting article. A society of individuals and organizations that would expend the time and resources to use a series of 'digital pseudonyms' to avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother obsolete but acts on the assumption that big brother is ever present. I view your system as a form of societal paranoia. As a matter of principle, we are working to enact formal legal protections for individual privacy rather than relying on technical solutions. We want to assume a society of law which respects legal limits rather than a society that will disobey the law, requiring citizens to depend on technical solutions. e.g. require a judical warrant for government interception of data communications rather than encrypt all messages on the assumption that regardless of the lawt the government will abuse its power and invade privacy. As a matter of practicality, I do not think your system offers much hope for privacy. First, the trend toward universal identifiers is as much.-a movement generated by government or industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions. At best, your system would benefit the sophisticated and most would opt for simplicity. The poor and the undereducated would never use or benefit from it. Finally where there's a will, there's a way. If government wants to link data bases, it will, by law, require the disclosure of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it for data bases which the government wants to link. Since corporations make money by trading commercial lists with one another, they will never adopt the system or if it is adopted, will use "fine printn contracts to permit selling various codes used by their customers to other firms. The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual autonomy. Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such consensus. Sincerely Yours, /Sig/ Jerry J. Berman Chief Legislative Counsel & Direrector ACLU Privacy Technology Project	11
Wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack? Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces the given ciphertext. He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average. In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves. If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses. (Here I have assumed that the DES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed. Is this so or do the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)	11
Another idea: Use a laptop computer. As mentioned earlier, the LCD screen is a lot less noisy than a standard CRT, but since many laptops have power supplies that run at 3 volts instead of 5, they would be considerably quieter. Doug Holland	11
Why not? It hasn't been released, so there's no way for you to evaluate it yet. After all, Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash encrypted with RSA, just like PKCS signatures. They could even be actually PKCS compliant, for all you know; why not wait until it is released, and hard information is available, before passing judgement on it? AOCE's algorithm's aren't secret because Apple's being fascistic--AOCE itself remains secret (except for Apple demos at MacWorld :)), simply because it's not done yet. It may be flawed, and it may not. However, you can't tell which until you actually see it. I, at least, am quite impressed with what I have seen so far, and have no expectation of being disappointed.	11
May I suggest that any any proposed cipher system having less entropy than the user's key and message can have an embedded subliminal channel as big as the difference in entropies between the entropy of the user input (message) and the entropy of the output? For example, take plain DES. The unsuspecting user inputs a string "PLAINTEXT" to be enciphered. He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked by George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d. Nine char in and nine chars out. Right? The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message "PLAINTEXT" is produced. Everything fine, right? Nope. Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression on PLAINTEXT before DESing. (Compressing is down to four characters with more entropy: 9#wj The opponent now pads the message with his own message, also compressed *3dk@ before applying DES to the concatenated compressed pairs. When decrpyted, the first compressed message is stripped off and declared sent. Unbeknowst to the receiver, the opponents accomplice collects the remaining message in the bit bucket and uncompresses to KILL NOW. And to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channels you would need to have maximal entropy all the time -- which is a priori impossible because (for example) a stereotypical message might be replaced by one bit in the output reserving the rest of the output bits for the long covert message. In other words, if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm -- you either have got to muck with it LAST or concede his possible embedding of covert channels. In other words, if you present a message to an opponet with less than maximal entropy then you have given him free bits of storage.	11

That is not true, with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined without the full search. I am not willing to take that bet. You can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip...... As for the key, it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to the chip, so I can pick my keys too. BING BING BING BING BING, THAT EXACTLY MY POINT, SINCE WE CANT KNOW THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS CAPABILITY, THE ONLY SAFE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THEY DO... i admit that most of my cryptographic complaints are probably unfounded, but since we cant know one way or the other, im not gonig to take their word for it.... Oh come on, thats like saying you could evaluate DES without the S-box constants.....	11
Just thought of something. Yes, laptops can still be read, but it's not quite as easy as a normal pc with a CRT. My thought, Airline pilots lately have been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's instruments. If this can be hyped up, manufacturers may start building laptops with even lower emmisions. It would probably still be possible to pick up with surveillance equipment, but at this point, it would be a lot cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques. Doug Holland	11

I would guess that they won't use Clipper at all. What they will do is use their STU-IIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies they need to talk to, and ignore Clipper.

I posted an informational request about any electronically available articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago. As I mentioned, I was interested, in particular, in DES and Public-Key -- but also wouldn't mind learning about others. As I said, I can read an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though not much number-theory per se. I'd like to see the technical details of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations of things like _scientific am_ which just say, "then you find a *really* big prime number....". Following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest reading-lists, which I hope to get around to. Two other people were so *very* kind as to send large documents, which I presume were actual articles (about 1000 lines each); but I've stupidly deleted them accidentally before having a chance even to skim them. If they can forgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original senders be so kind as to resend? Or anyone else who has good crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? Also, ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about. Yours, Lulu...	11

This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in DES. Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications Review and Usenix. For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the Kerberos mailing list even earlier. The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do with bad password selection.	11
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Gasp! I've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader I guess) and I really have to put out a few comments too. First, let me flame the famous Dave S. : He's obviously only 10 years old. Cut him some slack. :^} The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof. Nice job guys! I've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years now, Clinton's actions so far have really helped. But because of government action taken against various other groups, I have developed a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list. The S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57 based on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough. (The reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s-boxes, I know it's only a vector, but it sure makes random search a pain). Several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use/sales. It's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org, *but* you will be watched. It really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by the "cripple chip". Amazingly enough they do listen when they get *enough* mail. The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and the IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we *are* seeing some changes. It's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs. As Vesselin points out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be again depending on how the vote goes). But just as criminals have guns and "law abiding" citizens don't, and criminals like me have marijuana and "law abiding" subjects don't, criminals like me will have secure crypto while "law abiding" robots don't. PGP is nice, but as time goes on we all can do better. And to save our hides we will. Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli. He's my favorite dude. 500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain that to "princes" who wanted people to *obey*. One section not quoted (I've got "The Prince" at home, so I'll just paraphrase :) ) had to do with conquring a free city. The only way is to *completly destroy* it. Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people's customs. Even after 100 years of oppression, a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government. And he gave an example. And that was 300 years *before* Thomas Jefferson. There were questions about watching traffic. Only *interesting* traffic is watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords like marijauana, cryptography, NSA; certain individuals who are known subversives, etc. It is easy enough to store all that traffic. So if you know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it's pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time. The stronger your crypto system and the less you're noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses. Which gets me to the thread about a "public encrypted conference". That's just silly. The first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you're doing. It will be fun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it's pretty pointless. Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana. Guns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in government who want you to *obey* their rules. As Lundquist says in alt.drugs "Live free or don't". Machiavelli pointed out that's just how most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary. It's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as Intergraph's!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the U.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might think. Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be hurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom. de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government. And given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne National Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.

The clipper chip's User key is formed by: R1 = E[D[E[N1;S1];S2];S1] R2 = E[D[E[N2;S1];S2];S1] R3 = E[D[E[N3;S1];S2];S1] Why is the triple-encrytion used? Is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch? (If so, why use 80 bit keys?) Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm, it's not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess S1,S2. Why are N1, N2, and N3 formed as they are? It would be facinating to see the Skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way. Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form N1,N2,N3 come from? Are they changed from chip to chip, or session to session? (Even if they're published in the NY Times, if SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks, when using triple- encryption, then there's no break in security. But why allow that kind of weird format? If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, then maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack, if it exists, can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production run of these chips....) Does Dorothy Denning read this group? If not, is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her, or Martin Hellman, or anyone else who's seen more details about the chip?	11
I tried this code yesterday. On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over 300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech. This means that it needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable in even a half-duplex mode. I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application. It produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads. We want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's without DSP cards. My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting point.	11
Sounds great. But how would something like this be done? Start up a news group for discussions of things like lobbying tecniques and how to get non-computer geeks as pissed-off as we are?	11
Sorry, my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a subject header. This tracks the thread "why people don't need strong crypto....." The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building nuclear devices. While I was in grad school, a friend of mine got a security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine. He found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the local engineering library (Madison Wisconsin). So the lawyers sent him all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in the article was already public. What pissed everyone off was a local underground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been precensored by the feds, that's what this was all about) so the judge declared the case moot. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court. From my discussions with several people familiar with the case, only 2 other times has this preemptive clause been used. In every case the people simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out. For all intents and purposes, the government *does* have precidence for declaring things classified *after* it has been published. While I was working on Star Wars this happened to me: my clearance was in the works and I developed a method for tracking particle beams. It was good enough to classify, so I was no longer allowed to work on it. A friend from Canada was in the same boat: he developed a method to compute stripping cross sections, but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed to present his own paper at a conference!*. He later published it in an open journal without problems. When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro. The feds can do whatever they want whenever they feel like it, and they will make up rules to let themselves get away with it. Since the mass media can't tell the difference between a joke and the real thing (like "ranch appocolypse" for the Waco massacre) don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss of freedom. The government *can* make strong crypto illegal. SO WHAT? Since the government does not obey any of its own rules, why should we?	11
Mr. Sternlight, your naivete and historical ignorance is appalling. [ History lesson detailing 1968-74 deleted. ]	11
Khufu and Khafre are both patented (#5003597). Biham and Shamir showed that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round Khafre with a chosen- plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions. Khafre with 24 rounds can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions. (There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks, if someone wants to take the time to look.) Khufu has key-dependent S-boxes, and is immune to differential cryptanalysis. Source code for this algorithm (and Khafre) are in the patent. Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function. The version of Snefru that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis (vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for four passes or less. Given that, SHA and MD5 are much more efficient. Oh yes, anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre, Director of Patent Licencing for Xerox, (203) 986-3231.	11

There's an out for him. The announcement talked about strong cryptography I believe. Specifically: nor is the U.S. saying that "every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product." Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable -- so this was sloppy wording. I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSA's best, secret algorithms. I don't want any NSA algorithms, actually. I'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and RSA's.

I'd use a secret (nope, obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the 30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. The redundancy hereby introduced can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy replaced the L.E. block by random data. And of course the L.E. block would be used to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E. block must be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back. For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E. block (e.g. by xor-ing a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. If the receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and it will cease to work; in your own interest you are protected from getting faulty plaintext, you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own safety ;-(. The `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI; but nothing prevents them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E. blocks within the transmission. These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol. So don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E. about the tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks than those suggested above. Of course it's absolutely crucial that the algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. Personally I doubt they will.	11
We would like to keep it that way. Thats the point. By reacting strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain free. You cannot overreact to a threat like this. The worst that happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. The worst that happens if we underreact is tyranny. I prefer overreaction myself. Doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is? Only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. I suggest that overreacting now and in the future is a good thing. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com	11
We had a senior NSA scientist in Cambridge at one of our workshops recently (in fact he was here when the Clipper announcement was made, but we didn't learn of it till after he'd gone). He said on this point that he was forbidden by law to monitor conversations between US nationals (and he is a chap who is very precise about his choice of words). So I don't expect he'd have any qualms about monitoring a domestic US conversation if one of the parties was an alien. However it got me thinking of the Navajo code talkers. Just imagine: + `Hello, is that the Iraqi mission in New York? This is the Iraqi foreign + ministry in Baghdad, I am Farouq Hussein, US citizen, social security number + so-and-so' + `Yes, indeed, this is the New York mission, Mustafa Jadid speaking, also a + US citizen, my social security number is such-and-such, here is our report + on activities against the Satan Clinton'	11

The same could be said for many other goverment agencies, but big budgets, large staffs, and long lead time haven't made many of them into models of effectiveness. The fact is that those of us outside the inner circles have only James Bamford's word that the people at the NSA use those legendary masses of computers for anything other than reading netnews, like many of us. The NSA *doesn't* have an impressive record of accomplishments, at least not a public record.	11

Actually, David, I don't think it's any more intellectually honest to say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you've had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely. For all we know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break. And clearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.	11
Does anyone know where I can get a hold of some secure encrypting chips or devices before they are banned completely?!? Steve	11
Doesn't matter if we assume they are obeying the law, since they won't have had a court order to tap calls prior to the date of the court order, and thus won't have them available. If they aren't obeying the law, we are in an entirely different discussion, in which this is the least of one's worries. David	11
That would be a V4 ticket, presumably, not a V5 ticket. The V4 ticket format can even be complicated several more orders of magnitude...	11
So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.? It would be nice to know that they are not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government. While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon, regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm. There is no proof that the chip won't squeel and role over for someone with the proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link. The design examination should be done to the gate level. Also, how does one verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout, or masks? The silicon should be examined as well, the design in hand (a clean room publicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later, or changed between completion and mask out. There is little proof that what you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip. Put the (verified) masks in escrow, and use them for chip production, use a third escrow party for programming the chips.	11

How come the media is not telling about the provisions of the Clipper decision? The provisions of the Crime Bill? The abuses of Civil Forfeiture? The government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want gun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the Holocaust is... The people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of rights are going on quietly. When they find out (when it hits them), it will be too late. One cannot expect each citizen to spend all their time probing, searching, researching, etc. For example, how big a percentage of the average population even has access to USENET? Way less than 1 percent, I bet. How many outside of Internet/USENET are even AWARE of what Big Brother is doing, or have been exposed to arguments of both sides of the issue?

(Sorry about double posting, but I forgot something.) "make, use or sell" in this context have non-standard meanings: "Make" means making an encrypted message. "Use" may mean using PGP, or using an encrypted message. "Sell" would probably mean selling an encrypted message. It is the message created by a "patented" process incorporated in PGP, which infringes.	11
This is an interesting point. As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb, you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods. (The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: Products that sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell thousands of units/year will be at the high end. I suspect cellular phones are in the middle). This implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%. I don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this. -tony	11
In the article "At last! Now you can talk to your computer." in the May issue of FORTUNE magazine, it was mentioned that phoneme prediction used Hidden Markov Modeling. This was the statistical method that Markov developed to predict letter sequences in Pushkin's novel, _Eugene Onegin_. It was then said that this technique worked so well that the NSA used it to crack codes. Does anyone have any references for HMM and how the NSA used it? Or is this just an extension of the letter frequency tables that we are all using anyway?	11
OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption export through the ITAR. Here's a question. Say I develop this great new encryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide. The thought police then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security. You will not be permitted to export it." At this point, what kind of trouble could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international customers anyway? First of all, it's not the thought police, it's the export police. If you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head, write the software there, and then sell it, the US Thought Police probably can't do too much about it, though you might want to check with your lawyer first. However, if you write the program here, and sell it to furriners, you are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the clink for *many* years, especially if they decide you'd be a good example, and Cuban Drug Dealers and Fanatic Middle Eastern Terrorists buy your stuff. (Definitions of "public domain" are different for ITAR purposes, so if you've got a good enough lawyer who'll do your case for free after they've confiscated everything you own as evidence, you might win. But nobody wants to go first, since the stakes are _quite_ high.)	11
[...] OK Steve, here's a sketch of an alternative that I believe addresses most of the objections to the Clipper scheme. Notation: + concatenation ^ exclusive or E(M,K) message M encrypted by key K D(M,K) message M decrypted by key K H(M) hash (digest/signature) of message M Important Values: U0[X] local chip unit key from escrow agency X U1[X] remote chip unit key from escrow agency X N[0] serial number of the local chip N[1] serial number of the remote chip A number of escrow agencies K[0],K[1] "session keys" agreed upon external to this protocol F "family key", need not be secret Protocol: Choose K0[1],...K0[A] such that K[0] = K0[1]^...^K0[A] Remote chip does same for K[1],K1[1],...,K1[A]. Compute the following: L0[1] = E(K0[1], U0[1]) ... L0[A] = E(K0[A], U0[A]) L[0] = N[0] + E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F) Remote chip does the same for L1[1],...,L1[A],L[1] Send L[0] to remote chip and receive L[1] from remote chip Compute: KE[0] = H(K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] + K[1] + D(L[1], F) KD[0] = H(K[1] + D(L[1], F) + K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A] Note that D(L[1], F) = N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A] Remote chip does the same for KE[1] and KD[1] User data is encrypted (decrypted) with keys KE[0], KE[1] (KD[0], KD[1]) Assumptions: No trap doors in E(), D() and H(). H() is not invertible. Algorithms for E(), D() and H() are secret. Otherwise a software implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip. The chip only supports the following operation: 1) Return N[0] 2) Load K0[x] 3) Return E(K0[x], U0[x]) 4) Return E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F) 5) Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F), return N[1],L1[1],...,L1[A] 6) Load K[1] 7) Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F), compute KE[0], KD[0] 8) Given M, return E(M, KE[0]) 9) Given M, return D(M, KD[0]) Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying the chip (U[1],...,U[A],F,N[0]). U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip. (Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.) The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies. Notes: For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1], E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y]. LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies to record that both chips were tapped. LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements. Observation: In order for any secure by "tap-able" communication scheme to work, the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made "un-tap-able". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm and the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggests that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm. rsbx ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Raymond S.

Hmmmmmm. $30 seems a bit expensive. How big is the chip? What kind of packages will be used? 3 volt or 5 volt technology? How much current will it draw? I think there are many practical questions that haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists! OK, I've got a big problem with all of this. How in the world do you expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved in this programming procedure? 2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at a time: give me a break. And how long does all of this take? Even if it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to turn out 300 of these things. How long do you suppose it will take to program those 10,000 chips mentioned above? This is highly impractical! So where can I find info on this AT&T device? What kind of vocoder does it use? Does it require ISDN phone lines? If not, is it full duplex? How does it sound? What kind of synchronization scheme is used? Will all other little black boxes have to conform to AT&Ts choices of protocol, etc.? Will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that conform to these specifications?	11

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec) into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time first. DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this problem. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com	11
The War on some drugs has already turned alot of police into criminals. This is yet another nail in the constitution's coffin.	11
It also goes like this: FED1: We need to listen into <mafia head/druglord/terrorist/BBS sysop>'s conversations but don't have probable cause for a tap. FED2: Who do we have a tap on? FED1: <some other enemy of the state>. FED2: So get the keys - we can always claim that phone's being used on the tapped line. There's got to be some way to associate an instrument with an individual or the state effectively has a tap, possibly not admissible (given the War on Drugs exceptions to the 4/5 ammendments, who knows) but none the less listenable tap on any phone.	11

Not when your talking about cryptography. Think again. You won't see me using apple's new signature from the finder feature. This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two squirts about credibility. In addition, Apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasn't survellience. Quite the opposite: "On January 24, Apple will introduce.... Macintosh, and you'll see why 1984 won't be, like '1984'" So don't give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more.

Following is a short note commenting on den Boer and Bosselaers' recent work on the MD5 message-digest algorithm. Feel free to email questions or further comments. -- Burt Kaliski RSA Laboratories ---------------------------------------------------------------------- \documentstyle[12pt]{article} \begin{document} \title{On ``Pseudocollisions'' in the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm} \author{Burton S. Kaliski Jr. \\ {\tt burt@rsa.com} \and Matthew J.B. Robshaw \\ {\tt matt@rsa.com} \and RSA Laboratories \\ 100 Marine Parkway \\ Redwood City, CA 94065} \date{April 23, 1993} \maketitle A message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a ``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the digest is easy, finding a message with a given digest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the same digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms have many applications, including digital signatures and message authentication. RSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron Rivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest. Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a second. While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved} secure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps to a 128-bit digest. Inversion should take about $2^{128}$ operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations. No one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision. Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's internal compression function, which maps a 512-bit message block $x$ and a 128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output state. They show how to find a message block $x$ and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach exploits structural properties of the collision function to find a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one would expect. Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of MD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real collision, since it involves two different messages, would almost always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same message blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are the same except for four bits. There does not seem to be any way to extend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit. It is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in MD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions and not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure. \bibliographystyle{plain} \begin{thebibliography}{1} \bibitem{den-boer-md5} Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers. \newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}. \newblock In {\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993. \newblock Preprint. \bibitem{rfc-md5} R.L.

There are companies (one in Canada, as I recall) which specialize in analyzing chips to understand process technology, design rules, ... to understand the probable yield of the assembly line making them, and therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves, given design shrinks, statistical quality control -> better yields, etc. Taiwanese, Japanese and especially Korean semiconductor manufacturers have all (korea continues) reverse-engineered foreign chips and produced the chip. Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual property treaties, and now at least extract the gate/transitor level design before laying the chip out again. The koreans still use mask-level copying, I believe. At least, they are under a lot of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property standards. All this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs. There are lots of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design. For a complex chip, there will be real intellectual effort extracting the gate design from the transistor design, and the algorithm from the gate design. But it won't take two smart guys even 6 months, working 40 hour weeks. Koreans work 60 or more 8) Lew	11
Now, almost 100 years later, we have the right words for the problem here. Phone calls are "virtual visits". Those experienced in virtual reality would know from that title that phone calls need to have all the properties of a walk in the park with your friend -- security from casual overhearing and easy verification to see if anyone is listening secretively. As designed, they fail at that. ..trouble is, telephones were invented a long time ago and people didn't realize the danger or the concept of virtual reality back then.	11
I'm not sure it has been established that the government can prevent you from sending an algorithm abroad. The NSA seems to have won by intimidation so far. Why don't you try it? ;-) Of course you could just distribute your algorithm widely for free and screw them up big time. (That would be my approach ;-))	11

I don't think mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of the clipper encryption scheme. So, his "assurances" are of no value at al, if he gives them he just says what a panel of experts(?) told him. If I lived in the USA, I would hope those experts were not paid by the <fill here you favorite 3-letter combination>. "The doctrine of plausible deniability". No-one is going to tell him it has a back door. The NSA will assume he has the sense to work it out for himself or they wouldn't be pushing it. Clinton might even *believe* the NSA when they tell him, for the record, it doesn't have a back door. And no FOIA request in the world will ever find it. These guys don't play by that set of rules. They have their own rule book, and no, you're not allowed to see that either.	11
Can you tell us more?	11
There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject. For example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian Federal computers. (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including concerns about NSA's involvement.) Note also that NSA is specifically charged with running the National Computer Security Center, -- to quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private sector use.''	11
I am both new to this news group and to the net. I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP encryption program.

The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. This makes the funding separate from government. It also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on, the scheme breaks down, and the government is back to the drawing boards, assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime. In fact, maybe this should be part of the "official" system. Before the government is allowed to move this past the "experimental" stage, they should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption. The government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the use of government funds for social programs--they should have to make a similar feasibility demonstration (on economic viability cum acceptance terms) for this baby as well.

The "low radiation" claims one sees on monitors these days pertain to allegedly harmful electromagnetic emissions, which does not necessarily have anything to do wtih TEMPEST security. (I think the alleged hazard is BS, but that's another topic.)	11
I wouldn't think so. Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems unsound to me.	11
Gentlefolk, It seems to me that the "Step 1" of taking a warrant to the telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (don't you love animal metaphors). With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip ("E(N;F)" is not syntactically different than "N"), all they have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of today's target and use the serial number to identify the session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of the conversation. Even without the key, this is great for traffic analysis. I can think of several ways to learn the right serial number. It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your alligator clips erect). This is particularly handy if you have S1 and S2. BTW, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial number?

Tom Clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from building a nuclear bomb. However, he asserts that you can find these key steps in any university library. The main point of _Five Minutes To Midnight_ is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible materials are nearly impossible to control. Read this article, or better yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a nuclear weapon. Doug Holland	11
I just posted this reply to comp.risks (answering RISKS DIGEST 14.53). Summary: Re: [14.53 Mark Seecof] "key escrow" It is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation here, thanks to our pet computers. This is not true. David Kahn's "The Codebreakers", a history of cryptography, makes two things obvious: 1. Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals and has been going on for thousands of years. [Teen-age slang and cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous creation.] 2. The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure today). [e.g., In places, the Bible used a more complex simple substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches, but before Caesar.] I commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested.	11
Better, I think, is our right peacably to assemble. I have a right to meet you in a park and talk privately. I have a right to see if anyone is nearby, listening. In cyberspace, cryptography gives us a right to assemble with control over who overhears us.	11
I have a couple reasons why I would be more likely to trust this algorithm: 1. The algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented. 2. The keys will NOT be escrowed. Of course if either of these is not true, I will not use this new algorithm. Since I have never seen this new algorithm, I have no idea how secure it is yet. I can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but I do notice that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know about Clipper.

Hi everybody! Does anyone know of companies that are currently manufacturing encryption chips for sale to the general public? Get them while you can! Some pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thanks	11
something that no one has discussed yet (or I missed it): The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed. Only at this point they can access the line and detect the serial number N. What happens next, does the FBI simply asks for the keys for N, and, since a warrant was issued for the line, the FBI simply gets it? What if multiple phones are used from the same house, the FBI just asks for N1, N2, etc.? Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some other serial number, X, was also used over the wirtapped line and get the keys for X? Either a second court order (for the specific serial/key) is required (and I have seen no indication of this), or the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any time, so the escrow key holders are a total fake. An unrelated issue: if and when all phones always use the clipper chip, how are call-transfers going to take place?!	11
	11
Exactly what would that show, ?! the "law enforcement block" is easy to create, given the Government key and any serial number. *IF* it comes to trail about the wiretap.... ya, some safegaurd that is. What if they just harass people as a result, or learn things they shouldn't have learned, etc? The whole point of the Escrow system is to prevent the FBI from making illegal wiretaps. Why not have the FBI holds the keys and that's it? Why do we need the escrow system at all? Unless a 3rd party (a judge) verifies that the requested serial number is "right", and the FBI can get any key they like at anytime, the escrow system is useless.	11
I don't believe you, and I don't believe your friend. Why? Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily availble. Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret, he was bullshitting you. Now, it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of the Kerberos protocol. For instance, using a weak RNG to generate keys might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys -- for the other kind who's name I can't remember). However, this is not what was claimed. You are claiming a general weakness in DES, which is not known to exist in the open literature. Don't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be. However, cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking machine than ANY organization I know of has available. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com	11

Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the call, from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first, or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field? Even assuming one of the first two choices, the FBI is going to get a fresh N,U for its own database about every other phone call, eventually accumulating keys for all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring, not just the 'suspects' key. (Assuming the ever-thrifty FBI doesn't forget each key after its wiretap permission has expired.) Not quite a pyramid, but not bad, either.	11
David, Neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. The feds, unlike Apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which to hang your freedom. Why? Because unlike Apple in (2), the govt has no credibility to lose. I'm serious about this. One can name just about any agency -- the IRS, RTC, FCC, FAA, FBI, NSA, CIA -- and find numerous examples of the public trust run roughshod over. Worse, one can rarely find in such examples any serious consequences to the offending agency. Even supposing we could get a reign on trust somehow, there's always the matter of competence in govt agencies. Can they even trust themselves? -mel P.S. I was amused when you mentioned the USDA as an example of an agency capable of managing the an escrow. I'm a consultant to the USDA, and while those *I* work with are wonderful <grin>, the agency itself is ranked in industry publications such as Govt Computer News as one of the worst caretakers of its computer resources. Recently, Prime Time Live did a long segment on the USDA's computer troubles. They are making a concerted effort to change, but intentions don't make a track record.	11
Why are people willing to trust the STU-III? Because the government does?	11
Thanks. Got that from two other sources as well. The full quote is as follows: From Dorothy Denning, CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY, Addison-Wesley 1982,1983, page 8: "Cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements: "1. The enciphering and deciphering transformations must be efficient for all keys. "2. The system must be easy to use. "3. The security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of the keys and not on the secrecy of algorithms E [enciphering] or D [deciphering]." --Mike	11

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from Friedman: "No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes from someone who has already broken a very hard one." Historically, Friedman has been right. It's really hard to develop a good cypher. IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have been fatally flawed. Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. The first two tries at public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken. Most if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were broken eventually. Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption have been disappointing; the classic "A survey of data insecurity packages" in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the popular "security packages" of the late 1980s. A new, proprietary algorithm? No way. If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has to be weak; that's how the current regulations work. Currently there's a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms (I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported. I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out. John Nagle	11

I can't answer all our questions in detail, but I can take a stab at them. The form the operations that compute R1, R2, and R3 is, of course, the famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with DES. It's much stronger than a single encryption, and has an effective key length of 160 bits. For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized, a simple double encryption would not have the same strength. Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys. It's recommended for anything of very high value. And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit that description. Why n_1, n_2, and n_3? Well, you need different plaintext values. I have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not. At a guess, they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible. A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change -- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns, and there might, conceivably, be a weakness. So the n_i values are -- and I'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming distance. In any event, I'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the S_i from the U_i, let alone U. (Observe: if the NSA has U, they don't need to find S_i. But even if they do, they can't get U_1 and U_2. In theory, they should never even see those values, even with a warrant.) The real question, I think, is why use this scheme at all, as opposed to a hardware random number generator. My answer is that this is *much* more verifiable. Look -- suppose that NSA, NIST, the ACLU, the EFF, and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number generator, and that it passed every test you could think of. When you come back next week to program some more chips, does it still work that well? Have any components changed in value? Have the components been changed out from under you? Does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting 1 bits? Yes, you can run detailed statistical tests on it again, but that's hard. Consider, on the other hand, a software solution. You bring your own floppies with you, you can run cryptographic checksums, etc. It's a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged, in other words. (Yes, I can think of ways to cheat software, too. I think that they're a lot harder.) There are three issues with Clipper. The first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working. My answer, with one significant exception, is yes. I really do think that NSA and NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be, assuming that their real objectives are as stated: to permit wiretapping, under certain carefully-controlled circumstances, with a minimum risk of abuse. (The exception is that U exists outside of the chip, on a programming diskette. That's seriously wrong. U_1 and U_2 should be loaded onto the chip separately.) To those who disagree (and I don't claim my answer is obvious, though I found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions section of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the scheme), I issue this invitation: assume that you were charged with implementing such a system, with complete regard for civil rights and due process. What would you do differently? In answering this question, please accept NSA's fundamental assumptions: that both strong cryptography against outsiders, and the ability to wiretap *some* domestic users, is necessary. (If you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions, do it in the context of the last issue I present below. Right here, I'm discussing *just* the technical aspects. And no, I don't by any means claim that just because something can be done, it should be.) The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be used. Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't mean that that's the only way they'll be made. Maybe the NSA will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping dock. And they'll generate bogus warrant requests, so that the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called. (``Sorry, guys; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple-DES phones instead. Who'd 'a' thunk it?'') I have no answer to this question, and at the moment, I don't see a way of answering it. Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question, below. The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law. I think that the answer is no, but it's not a no-brainer. I'm a civil libertarian, not a libertarian, for reasons that I explained at great length on the net in the Elder Days, and that I don't have the energy to repeat now. But that means that I'm willing to accept that some laws are necessary, so long as they respect the essential rights of individuals. The government already has the ability and -- in our system -- the right to issue search warrants, and while that power has certainly been abused, it's also been used quite properly and fairly in other cases. Is key escrow sufficiently different? I think so -- but again, it's not an easy question for me. (It is easy for libertarians to answer, of course, since Clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their (oft-admirable) philosophy. And it's also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government, a group I'm much more distant from.)	11
Arthur Melnick posts an interesting first-hand message about his NEA algorithm. Though I have no reason to disbelieve anything he says, I want to clarify one point: He says he has no connection with the NSA. If he was part of an "NSA plot", of course he'd say that. Now I don't think he is. But the level of some discussion here is of that sort, and very quickly we reach the point where it's impossible to continue rationally discussing some issues. "I am not a crook" "Well, if you were, of course you'd say that" or the ever popular favorite: "Please prove the following negative." I don't know what to do with such messages, so I have taken to ignoring them. Comments? David	11

There is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the May 1993 issue of BYTE, p. 134, attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali. The way it works is as follows: You generate your private key S, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3, s4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = S. You give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different escrow agency. The agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the public key telephone book keeper. The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reduces the result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key. Now, if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies, and the user could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result would be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system.	11
There are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion. They can't be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the PBX line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased T1s or satellite circuits. I can't remember the generic term for these chips. My impression is that this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that it isn't done much now. Lew	11
Firstly, an aside: I agree that the weakness exists, but I have a lot of trouble believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given: 1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security, and the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients really do want that level of security 2. These same people want to keep P a secret I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P lying around. (I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small part of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in C her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find this at least as surprising.) Back to the question: If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I would also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided, and I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following for discussion. Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to share, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input, she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond. What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message. (Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't have exactly the same effect). Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC computed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad): 1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S 2. break C2 into n-bit chunks 3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector) 4. for i in each chunk sequentially set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i] At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code. (Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the plaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in the same manner.) NLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest non-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed (even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table called Sbox, and use: x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y]. Practically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never sees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid substitution on it. Also practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32 bits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail for the discussion at hand. Who will be first to point out my errors, or give me a pointer to some literature?	11

[excellent and helpful list deleted] Wes's list is of "do"s and "don't"s for writing your Congressional representatives is a fine one but I'd like to encourage people to pay extra attention to the point above. As cliched as the saying may be it's nevertheless true that you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. While the writing styles prevalent on the net possess a certain charm please remember that the person reading your letter is likely to be uninfluenced or negatively influenced if you express your concerns in a way that makes you sound like a flake or a paranoid crackpot. Wild and unsupported accusations about the menace from the NSA will not carry much weight, nor are overblown conclusions about the inevitable consequences of the proposal likely to convince (especially not ones that attempt strained analogies to the rise of the Nazi party. Please save the Niemoller quote for another letter..) If you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is *very* important that you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and seems reasonable to a layman. Don't overburden your reader with technical details or expect them to know the history of various encryption technologies. Before you mail it, hand your letter to a non-technical friend and ask them to sanity-check it. Above all, realize that legislators are often motivated as much by self-interest as by anything else. Try to point out risks in terms that will be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual privacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to American businesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace. Pull the strings that you think will work with your legislator -- if your legislator is unlikely to be swayed by civil-rights concerns then point out how a government-granted monopoly for Mycotronx damages the competitiveness of businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto technology.	11
Will someone please post the David Sternlight FAQ to alt.privacy.clipper before someone unfamiliar with him takes him seriously and starts yet another flame fest?	11
It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the FBI would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies. It wasn't clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not, or whether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals, or would do the whole message. One thing I'm a bit puzzled by: Why aren't they doing this with a public key scheme of some sort? You could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor for each chip. Then, escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies. Set the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys. To decrypt a message, both escrow agencies (in the right order, for most PK schemes) have to decrypt with the escrowed private key. This way, there wouldn't be thecconcern that, once the police had asked fo a warrant/wiretap, they would have your key forver.	11
: WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE? : SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars, : wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police. So the : proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part : in three thousand to be cost-effective. Robin's calculation is interesting and important, even if it's off by an order of magnitude (for example). Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO, the protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much higher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details of the phone call length, protocol, etc. (shorter calls get a proportionately greater hit). However, I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one's house are. -Tim May	11
Don't forget Chemical Abstracts Service (which is pretty much the international clearinghouse for all chemical information), whose former director (Ronald Wigington) and head of R&D (Nick Farmer) were openly former NSA employees.	11
I suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from offering secure encryption services. Big companies don't take that kind of risk. They're too visible and have too much to lose. The US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its use. If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT: you will receive no US government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on use of encryption, I doubt either organization would delay making use of encryption a violation of local policies. The US government gets much of its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be illegal if they were enacted as laws.	11
Quoting amanda@intercon.com (Amanda Walker) in article <1rn1b3$khb@news.intercon.com>:	11
I did. You're mistaken. NSA's communications intelligence mission is strictly against foreign governments. Here's an excerpt from the enabling charter (24 Oct 52, Truman) that should clarify this. The charter was declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public. Mind you, I don't know that they never collect anything they're not supposed to... but spying on US citizens isn't in their charter. b. The COMINT mission of the National Security Agency (NSA) shall be to provide an effective, unified organization and control of the communications intelligence activities of the United States conducted against foreign governments, to provide for integrated operational policies and procedures pertaining thereto. As used in this directive, the terms "communications intelligence" or "COMINT" shall be construed to mean all procedures and methods used in the interception of communications other than foreign press and propaganda broadcasts and the obtaining of information from such communications by other than intended recipients, but shall exclude censorship and the production and dissemination of finished intelligence. They're also tasked with protecting the US's communications, but I haven't seen the specific enabling memo on that. I assume that's the role under which Skipjack was developed. NSA is not in the standard-setting business, though -- that's why this Clipper stuff came from NIST, which I believe is tasked with coming up with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies, which would include NSA.	11
[ ... ] [ ... ] One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field. It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm. It seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be otherwise compatible, but would send out a bogus law enforcement field. This might render the device unusable with "normal" devices if there's some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field, but it could certainly be used with other such modified devices. Of course, this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the algorithm, but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system.	11
This doesn't work, due to the near-field far-field effect. You may stop someone five yards away from listening in, but someone fifty yards away will be relatively unaffected - unless you pump out hundreds of watts and jam all the neighbourhood TV's as well. In that case the government will stomp on you - ask any radio ham! Democratic governments care even more about their voters' right to watch soap operas than they do about national security, and dictators consider their propaganda to be an integral part of their national security. I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any problem. Most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. The description turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one. We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely expensive as the military Tempest kit, but which was well enough shielded to stop eavesdropping using available receivers. We built a prototype, it works, and it's still sitting on my lab bench. Commercial interest was exactly zero. In the absence of open standards, a monitor which really is `low radiation' (and costs 500 dollars more) can't compete against a monitor which just claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the pretty blue sticker on the box).	11
Nonsense. Mike, in Heinlein's "Moon is a Harsh Mistress" decides that a weapon is some mechanism which allows you to deliver energy at a distance. (I don't have the book handy or I'd find the exact quote). Guns do that. Cryptosystems do not.	11
Let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive orders to obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this information (unless things have changed withing the last little while). I suppose they could ignore it, if they choose. But I doubt they would. For an authoritative look at the NSA, get Bamford's "The Puzzle Palace". That's all I can say.	11

Taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else that has been published here about brute force DES cracking, unless Russell was lucky with respect to the key), I'd be very interested in whether the program Russell used is available? In whether he used a cleartext recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each decryption by hand? In whether he used a known plaintext attack? He probably should also tell us, given his address, what machine he used--a desktop, workstation, or super-computer. Depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development calling into question both DES and RSA/DES. Dunno about RSA/IDEA. If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single DES message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that are message-specific), then here's my Clipper key, NSA; give me the chip at once. :-) David	11
I have been scanning and trying to read the articles in the sci.crypt area, but what do I get? SURPRISINGLY, the blurb comes upon the screen " file xxx has either been cancelled or expired. Now I ask you, If it expired, wouldn't it be out of the available file cache? I am 32 and not a paranoid, but the older I get, the greater my cynicism of both federal and state governments becomes. The censorship of this Internet (and it is no less than censorship [stupid me, it's the GOVT.]) is ridiculous. The Japanese have far outstripped our ciphertechnology, and our government is now, before your very observant eyes, trying to force the "crypto standard" onto a framefork where the "standard" is now an ancient relic in terms of modern Japanese security techniques. Now, I pose the question: Why censor folks on the net and send the warning shown above ("cancelled or expired") when it would be wiser to not let people see the post at all?? Which Article of the Constitution gives me the right of revolution if things seem to be going cockeyed?? Hmmm...	11

The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip, as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein, raise yet another trust issue. Even if we assume that these "trusted agents" are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds (rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits), I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data. They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer, which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they are feeding into the system.	11
> Just curious, how would the Clipper Chip system handle > conference calls? It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system. I've seen a number of designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge. Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same key, it can be done. For example, I was using "vat", which is an Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the session. (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't have the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different site) So, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge. But if you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the conversation.... -derek	11
In some hobby shop, they sell a flexible tube (1/4-inch diameter, 18-inch ling) that will illuminate if you bend or shake it (it is also sold in amusement parks in the evenings). The brightness can last 2 to 4 hours. If it is left in refrigrator (in coldness), you can prolong its life of illumination.	11
>> conference calls? >It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system. I've seen a number of >designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge. A 'multi-line cleartext bridge?" ^^^^^^^^^ And just were would you put that bridge? If it isn't at one of the receiptants location, forget encryption at all. You have blown any security you thought you might have had. Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military (or equivalent, like CIA and other embassy personnel), so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal - it's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade, and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they're talking about Classified Stuff (or Golf with Other Generals.) That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob; most people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or Long Distance or value-added phone company (e.g. Alliance conference bridges). If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones, the conferencing aspects don't change. But there may be a market niche for trusted conference-bridge providers, though I suppose the inquisitors would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges, just in case a Bad Guy might use the service.	11

... Well, lets for a hypothetical put our selves in the place of the US end of the drug rings. What do we do about the Cripple chip? First off, we would express disaproval to our congress critters, and remind them of the large sums of money our legitimate co.s provide to their campain coffers. We would also let them know via the 'other' channels that a) their income is about to take a hit, and b) their health may not be too good either. But just in case, the next obvious step to take is to BUY Mycotoxic and VLSI! Yeah, free enterprise at work. :-) Now they have the Cripple in their pockets, literaly as well as figurativly. Tough about the masses though.	11
Evil and good walk hand in hand. It is also important to note that the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools. I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic. Technology is neutral to good or evil. When technology is used by "evil" men, it is called evil technology. When it is used by "good" men, it is called good technology. Really, it is just technology that allows action to be realized more efficently and on a larger scale. Try not to confused the development of technology with its use. Certainly, "bright" people will be better at creating technology, but even young children know how to program VCR machines. Are VCR machines not extremely complex to create? Adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the stiff and stubborn. A young child is soft and supple; an old man is stiff and inflexible. A dripping of water can cut through stone. This has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just allows us to magnify action. I have no objection to this! :)	11
Well, isn't this just a hoot! :) All I read on this group is a bunch of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt. This just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided that he would create and/or distribute some misinformation. Ppl buy into BS posts like this (I know, because I forwarded a copy of the post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't admit it...sorry Joe!) ready to get in a fight about F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E!!!) Please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and still has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow these too? Electronic Freedoms only go so far. Hey, I'm willing to forgive...after of course my office mate takes his extra anti-paranoia pills! :)	11
Yes -- great chapter. Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through. However, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact. (How's that for a revolving door?) Now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better cryptography. I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but .... So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum runners use the Clipper Chip?" Answer: you're not. Question: OK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our rights has evaporated. How do you justify our loss of rights if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?	11
It is completely clear. You have to assume that each byte that was encrypted by this 'Clipper Chip' has been compromised. Some people wondered, why Denning, Hellman and others did not respond, when asked what would be done about such compromised phones, or if compromise could not be restricted in time. (I did too) Let us just assume that a) They do not know and b) Those who know don't tell and c) They do not care. It seem's to be an 'Other Person's Problem' ... gec	11

I came. I lurked. I read the FAQ. Now having purchased the recommended books, and having taken to heart the advice that one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst, I would like to correspond with people interested in cryptology. I am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in Booch's OOD with Applications. I hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking them. I would like to start with simple Ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to David Kahn's book. Of course I would be interested in general discussions and math also. I hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the "men in the suits" I've been hearing so much about.

I received a fax of a letter from Representative Markey (Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance) to Ron Brown (Secretary of Commerce). Since encryption and the Clipper chip are raised in this letter, I felt it would be of interest. I understand that on 29 April, Mr. Markey will be holding a hearing on the questions raised in this letter. There may also be a follow-on hearing dedicated to the clipper chip, but that's not definite. I've typed in the letter, which follows. Any errors in transcription are mine... --- Glenn Tenney tenney@netcom.com Amateur radio: AA6ER Voice: (415) 574-3420 Fax: (415) 574-0546 ------------------ letter of interest follows ---------------- April 19, 1993 The Honorable Ronald H. Brown Secretary Department of Commerce 14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20236 Dear Secretary Brown: As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in a networked environment. Recent reports concerning the Administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption standard, based upon "clipper chip" technology, have raised a number of related issues. The international competitiveness of U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is a key factor that the government should consider when addressing issues of encryption and data security. As the nation moves forward in developing the national communications and information infrastructure, security of telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of users. The "hacker" community can compromise the integrity of telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the network. The people and businesses that use the nation's telecommunications network and the personal computers linked through it increasingly are demanding that information be protected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft. I am concerned that the Administration's plan may mean that to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies would be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. government customers, and another for private, commercial users who may want a higher encryption standard. This may inadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping to serve both markets. To assist the Subcommittee's analysis of this issue, please respond to the following questions: 1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the Administration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST or the vendor? If so, please identify such entities and the nature of testing performed. If not, please describe any plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how such experts will be chosen. 2. Under the Administration's plan, what entities will be the holders of the "keys" to decrypt scrambled data? What procedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to designate such key holders? 3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the Administration contain a "trap door" or "back door," which could allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to crack the code? 4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used for communications will require new techniques and additional equipment. How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid advancement of telecommunications technology? 5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place on the Federal government? What is the estimated cost to consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard in their equipment? 6. What is the Commerce Department's assessment of the competitive impact of the Administration's endorsement of the "clipper chip" technology on U.S. exports of computer and telecommunications hardware and software products? I would appreciate your response by no later than close- of-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993. If you have any questions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or Karen Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424. Sincerely, Edward J. Markey Chairman ###	11
I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip. If that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller. Can anybody verify or refute this?	11
I've been reading this board passively for a while now and find the subject absolutely fascinating, especially from the point of view of a civil rights nut like myself. My problem is that I'm new to the field and paragraphs like the above keep popping up. I'm sure what Mr. Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important, but I have NO IDEA what it means. :-) Anyway I'm keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on that explains this stuff in lay terms (I have a decent CS background, but not a huge amount of hyper-advanced math). Can anyone point me to a FAQ or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and maybe a little history as well? I read the piece in this month's WIRED, can anyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest? Thanks in advance, Steve.	11

In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography policies are acceptable, we must set forth a list of basic requirements. I would propose the following as a starting point: 1. The algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses. 2. The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is being used. 3. The key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search possible now or in the reasonably near future.	11

I can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme, though I'm not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide. An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable for Eve) block to the message, and then calculate a CRC which included the random starting block and all of the message. This could be encrypted after the message. The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting block. (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that* sure....) Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be stronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's unbreakable. A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad, either. At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your pad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext in a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going on. If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use of 2.5 times the message length. (We'd expand the message size by about half.) Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a guess for our would-be spoofer. At each bit, she has to guess. I'm trying to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the spoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un- synched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message. Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure as a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits. For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together to get X_i. Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad. The enemy has no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either. Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what R_i was. Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits? Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random bits as there are bits in the message. Clearly, this makes spoofing messages just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it. In fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the one-time pad?	11
Because much of the public aren't even aware of the NAMES of informative publications. Look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand. Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment, with the usual trade journals, all they ever see is the media (note: media in this context is the popular media - TV, radio, daily newspapers, and such publications as Time, Newsweek, and all that). And they all say pretty much the same thing. I see most of them being in the range of center-left to far Left, and generally supportive of pie-in-sky we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave. There seems to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them (as with Clipper, for example) or tells the people how to interpret events in others. What is lost sight of is that the people are not good at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information about them. It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be clarirvoyant. For example, I would have been unaware of Clipper had I not picked it up on USENET. How much of the population has USENET, let alone Internet access? For access to better publications, the person has to spend time digging. Many folks, especially who work long hours, have families, etc., do not have TIME to go digging, and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong, so are not motivated to dig. Not saying its right, just saying that is the way things are. People aren't upset about things when they aren't TOLD. And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the problem. And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service (bureaucrats, politicians) that act as if the person without political connections, or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if any rights, being a resource to be used by those in control for their polticial or financial gain. Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt, peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD, and get very nasty when someone questions them. The media pundits/editors, etc tend to fall into those with privilege, and tend to not be upset by the current state of affairs. The fellow in DC, who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi for daring to swim in it, with an ILLEGALLY owned gun (violating the law he pushed to be foisted on everyone else), ends up walking where a less well-connected person would have been crucified. A typical example of one standard for 'us', a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'. Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this, but the solution sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is going on, or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position where one feels they are exempt or insulated. Such as that hypocrite of a journalist in DC described above. One notices that these less-than complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the media. I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views on the subject, and it involved a 'brother' journalist. Isn't it time for our 'objective' media, the MAIN SOURCE of info for the average person, to start being what they claim to be, instead of spin doctors for the Statist elements?	11

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300- chip programming session. I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some people have envisioned. My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers used to generate the keys. Since we have to trust the escrow companies anyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from random seeds entered by the escrow agents. And since the algorithm for key-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is what is actually being put onto the floppies. And yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could be hard to check. The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each time. Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by the trusted escrow agents. Back doors in the chip could allow U to be recovered. Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring what was on the floppy.	11
I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years. Myktotronx refers to it as "Government Type II encryption", which matches the designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones, and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called "CIPHER2". This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem which can act as a "pin-compatible" substitute for DES. Combined with a tappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow. If this is fact the case, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself. Now, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent. However, it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES (and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law enforcement, and promote it for public use. This also fits with Mykotronx, who's been around but almost invisible for years. Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink elephants here? :). My curiousity has been piqued...	11
Interesting. Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have something else. If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can record it, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like they would the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect that there is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant, say for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abused great power in the past...). So I say "Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent. I am a paranoid sort, ya understand...". Will the result be "Sorry, without Government permission, we cannot sell you anything secure", or would it be "Sorry, we know which side our bread is buttered on, we cannot sell except to government people, law enforcement, and 'special' people...". What, in your opinion, would be the chances of "sure, we will sell you this secure system ... be happy to..." Also, please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private encryption of, say files transferred by modem, or FTP, or data stored on disk? SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning for us people on that.... With your rather intimate relationship with the FBI, NSA, etc. you must CERTAINLY have an idea. You are surely not going to say "the people are not to know, until it is too late..." This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't it? That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES? The BOSSES want to know what the *@()#*&(@ is going on here... You see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom from Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against violent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they arrive only in time to clean up the mess: I would be DEAD if I had to depend on 911...). You see, with all that talk about National smart ID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of means to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now), it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave. All it would take is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions... and with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably disarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now would there? All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ... drugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'. What is wrong with good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case? They don't want to have to be burdened to leave the office, it seems... Please read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US Constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish policy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't it?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote it? Reassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary, seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then springing it on us...). Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE to me. I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were NOT mentioned on the press release. I find that more than a little bit curious, don't you? I sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time... Yes, I am upset. I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could have been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago... I also recall it was not well received. Apparantly powers-that-be really didn't care (or were not told, or both). From what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't want the neighborhood kid listening in on. Any SERIOUS security I don't think I would want to trust it a bit. Might as well use cleartext. Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious trade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security. Given enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted. Buy a crooked judge, and a crooked cop. Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be hard to find. So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the Government with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop. You know the first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for THEIR communications. I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps to order a pizza). Tell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity, someone not using the 'government approved' methods? That just a desire to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen? Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door raid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools', using civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen? I have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the public magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great this is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion of privacy? That the government is going to be so kind as to let us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT? What you want to bet that I am correct here? Please answer these questions. As citizens of the United States, we hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have out of the goodness of their hearts... Funny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BIT safer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug. I am beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities, or our own government gone out of control? Re-assure us, please. So far, I haven't seen much to reassure me... and a LOT to greatly disturb me.	11

In what way David? Our government is totally out of control, whether you realize it or not. I know you find it painful to think of your old buddy Uncle Sam as evil but it's true. Other democracies have fallen before. Ours is on its way and knee-jerk sheep that instinctively trust government are helping it slide. Power corrupts David, why is that so hard to understand?	11
Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to comp.risks. I'll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it's a bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat. depends on the protocol that's followed for reading traffic. Briefly, the cops get a wiretap warrant, and record the call. They then notice the encryption and the disclosure header. It, along with a copy of their warrant, is sent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key. The F-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the encrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents. They, in turn, use U1 and U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police. Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever. Neither the cops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic. Every request must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents. The cops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U. (I regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the system. It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.) The escrow agents can't read the conversation, since they don't have it; all they have is N and U[K]. And the police don't even see N.	11
I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account. If anyone wants to E-mail him, all we need is his account number (i.e.: 12345,6789) and then we could e-mail him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma like so: "12345.6789@compuserve.com". (THIS IS *NOT* HIS ADDRESS.) So, does anyone know his e-mail address? He *says* he uses it all the time. (I wonder if he reads alt.fan.rush-limbaugh... His ego is big enough!)	11
I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper level routines into a single data link. The upper levels won't know about this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at the initial link establishment). I figure that I can do this with DES and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Is using a Diffie-Hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a setup? Are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from filtering out unacceptable keys)? And in order to achieve this, I guess I will need to use 64bit math routines (for probable prime number calculation, exponentiation etc), so could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly non-commercial). Matthew.	11
That's what MCI Mail is for! (CompuServe also has "CongressGrams" (TM).) This is not intended as an advertisement; that really is what MCI Mail WAS intended for (according to their ads).	11
Yeah, right, and if the ATF trashes your place on a bad tip they have to pay to repair it, sure. And if your computer equipment is confisticated in a raid they have to charge you with a crime within, say, 90 days. You're stretching the naivete bit on this one.	11
Doug Holland claims Tom Clancy has provided the recipe for nuclear bombs. Clancy himself says he has omitted certain crucial steps. Further, how do we know Clancy knows, rather than repeating what he's read or been told in the unclassified domain?	11
O.K.- if you've read this group for a while, you know all about the one-time-pad, but here's a question I haven't seen. The one-time-pad yeilds ideal security, but has a well-known flaw in authentication. Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad, and exclusive-or as the encryption operation. If an adversary knows the plaintext of a message, he can change it into any other message. Here's how it works. Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P, under a key stream S Alice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P, and sends it to Bob. Eve knows the plainext P, but wants the message to appear as P'. Eve intercepts C, and computes C' = C xor P xor P' = S xor P'. Eve sends C' to Bob. Bob decrypts C' by computing C'xor S = P', thus receiving the false message which was substituted by Eve. Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information theoretic security, not just computational security. Can we define something like "ideal authentication" which is the analog of ideal security. Can we obtain ideal authentication ? If not, how much can we limit Eve's control over the message ? If we can achieve ideal authentication, does the solution use more key bits or expand the message ? Can we show the solution to be optimal in one or more parameters ? Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before ?	11
I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However, using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court. Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ). The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things. If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data carried by a person rather than sending it electronically. The clipper chip will not change this. The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ? Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase in the next years. I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ? I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real danger and it can be helpful.	11
Hello, how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors? How much data per bit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)? Thanx for hints, Axel --- Experience is what you get if you don't get what you want...	11
You would be arrested as an international arms trafficker.	11
[...] [...] Again -- I'm extremely sorry about this.. I got this message several months ago (quite a bit before the clipper chip proposal) when it was posted to a different newsgroup. It was very startling to me as well, and I guess I should of verified the source at least to some extent before reposting.. Aaack..	11
You have underlined here the battle that must be fought. It is a battle for the "hearts and minds" of the american public. People must realize that the government is not their a fit "father confessor". The government does not have a right to share our every thought the moment we decide to share that thought with someone else at a distance. In order to protect ourselves from a government bent on undermining the constitution we must realize that our government is our enemy as much if not more than the Soviet Union ever was. This is hard for some people who have been brought up with loyalty to our government cast as being synonmous with patriotism. We must be vigilant and make sure that we do not let such events go by unprotested. We must be willing to fight the government at every step of the way. Its time we rolled back this nonsense. Civil forfeiture is the most effective end run around the constitution that has ever been promulgated. Our enemy used to be the Soviets now it is clearly our own government.	11
Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North, it looks like you could do worse than get the NRA involved. They have a kindred problem, a large number of voters, the right attitude, and lots of funds. From an ethical _or_ constitutional viewpoint, I haven't seen a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesn't also support the NRA position on guns (and vice-versa).

They also have a lot of the other voters really irritated at them. Okay, folks, I know I'm in the minority on this issue, but I can't let this assertion go unchallenged yet again. I'm going to say this ONLY ONCE, in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main topic. Guns are offensive. Cryptography is defensive. See the difference? The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else. Crypto- graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.	11
[...] No no no no no no no. It will go like this: FEDS: We need the key to phone 334RE67D99. ESCROW: You have a warrant to tap the line phone 334RE67D99 is on? FEDS: Yes. ESCROW: Fine, here is our key. What happens is, Feds tap a line; find Clipper is being used; extract serial number; get key; decipher convo. The serial number is never registered to a specific owner, it is _sent_ as part of the conversation. If I give you my Clipper phone, you do not need to re-register it (mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the first place). There are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper, but this is not one of them. Let's get our facts straight and not waste effort demolishing straw men. RA rogue@cs.neu.edu (Rogue Agent/SoD!)	11

Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystems. So far any references I have seen have been weasel-words ("more plans in the future, etc"), but nothing that could be taken as a "NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)". I have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has language that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard all systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems not trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys which one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by folks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either 'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'. Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY but by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY outlawed for all intents and purposes. Now, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now. Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY outlawing ANY class of crypto systems. For example, a crowbar, hammers, screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much at the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual possessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine use of these tools. In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need' (gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught using them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'. In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong security, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data, not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd. A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as a 'legitimate NEED': "Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law enforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity... DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE, HMMMM?" I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at random, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of 'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about this... (mega ':-('s) One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an argument used in the abortion debate): "You do NOT have a right to have security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'" (as suggested in the Clipper Press Release). This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening. Not only for crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set, laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately owned safes, and so on. WHY NOT?)... I cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those 'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution. A law cannot be easily declared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW. It would simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A simple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are mainly BATF policy decisions... The Conversation of the Fed agents would go something like: "We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank account, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your acquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers tools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no decent American Subject would be against these noble causes...". "Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying your HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing SOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'. Only a civil matter ... <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>". "Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>". "If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to PROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools' and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead, we have no problem with that! 'Course, with your bank assets seized, no car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your less-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical difficulties <grin>...". THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic... It is EXACTLY how the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been used to store DRUGS... Note no trace of drugs need to be found on the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup. I stored stuff in that dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for dealing). Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another day, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets... Ob Disclaimer (of course)... Ok, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture cases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies, or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where they are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be able to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East, like NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA). These people have the choice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case... All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind the Feds wanting to 'make an example'... Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'. Point is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too typical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable? And if not why not (what are our guarantees, besides the government promises)? NONE?	11

Big deal. If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a legitimate wiretap order, you just listen in on the line for 10 minutes, get the serial number, and then take the order and go to the escrow agencies. If you notice the criminal is now using a different phone instrument, take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow agency with the new serial number. (This provides opportunities for abuse by law enforcement, but thats not what we are discussing right now.) I oppose Clipper, but the mechanics here are simple and easy to understand. The whole rest of your article is based on a large series of false premises, all predicated on the notion that this simple act is somehow impossible. I feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand the mechanics of the proposal. Arguing that terrorists will be killing people for their clipper phones is silly because its pointless.

>Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see >the cryptosystem design. I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow the algorithm through to hardware. While I doubt the NSA would pull any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious opportunity to introduce additional holes. The chip isn't the place to pull the monkey business - you do it in the key generation, either by having a mathematical backdoor, or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the keys also save a copy of S1 and S2 and leak it out somehow, or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys on the chip actually put a *different* key there (VERY hard to detect, since the escrow agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or give each other the S* keys, and they still don't know the algorithm.) Or have the chip-burner at the factory make copies of the keys. Or whatever.	11
This is a real address. My understanding of the current process that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed by retiree volunteers, who match the message against message profiles and check the message count. (I.e.: "yeah, that's a for gays in the military. what's this clipper stuff? must be against gays in the military...") The higher-volume white-house email stuff is in the works, I know for a fact, but won't be online for probably another month or two at the soonest. My understanding is that the link speed will increase (direct internet instead of Compu$erve to floppy) but the message processing will remain the same. The white house email does get read. I agree that printing it and sending Cc: to everyone you can think of is probably better because it is more visible, but the message processing (fitting messages against a template) is the same in either case.	11
Yeah, but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law enforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association? I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit card info, voila.) At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person likely is in your house etc.), plus or minus some shenanigans of course. But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id, recording the conversation, then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes up as owner of that id (mistakenly, maybe you sold the phone at a garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They might only know who one side of the conversation is, for example. Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such databases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can of course do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any money for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just don't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess. Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.) I know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, I could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during a dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of a dispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason this fellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.) Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips. Be afraid. -- -Barry Shein	11
That was probably me. I meant only that nobody has overreacted yet. It seemed to me that Jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting, and I vehemently disagree. I see a lot of talk, but not much action. I see now that I misunderstood Jerry's position. Not this bunch. They'll just bitch on the Net for a while, and then go back to lurking. Actually, it's not quite that bad, but it's close. Look, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we don't use it. We clearly don't need to go burning things down, but we clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out. Unfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of people at a single time, so the masses won't react and throw them out. Eventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease their relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy. The sooner it happens, the less the damages will be. I don't want to live in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before they do some *real* damage.	11

As I read the current wiretap law, it would not be legal now. On the other hand, assuming a legislative change, recording but not decrypting Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme Court, using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which they permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers. Incidentally, if we use that as our model, the Court will likely not uphold selective recording. (On the other hand, I don't think they've thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet. Must be that exception to the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of Rights.) A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps (or Tipperclaps, for encrypted music?) are used. Don Alvarez showed in the latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from reading traffic after their warrant expires.	11
However, he said on his radio show today that he won't read anything from the two alt groups. He simply deletes them without reading them. He says that some of the people in the two groups are vicious.	11
You should probably use numbers much larger than 64-bits. Also, you may want to include some randomly-generated bitstrings in your protocol. This way, if someone should find the shared key you and another person use on one day, they won't be able to guess it for the next day.... Ie A sends G**A mod P and random string R0 B sends G**B mod P and random string R1 Both find (G**A mod P)** B mod P = Shared Key, then both calculate Session Key = Hash(R0,Shared Key, R1) Also, you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public key value G**A mod P. Someone with the power to intercept and change messages can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you *his* public key, and then acquiring a session key with each of you....	11
There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court. The concensus appears to be: You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker. (You could, regardless of the state of the law, but there are some paragraphs which suggest you would be violating the law.) If it goes to court, the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the First amendment; or the court could rule that "software" is "technical data" not subject to the ITARs; or the court could rule that the phrase "publicly available" as defined in the ITARs would apply, making it only subject to requiring a general export license; or, you could be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage. General concensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs, is that one of the first two would occur.	11
OK, I heard a lot of talk about the NSA's infamous control over encryption export through the ITAR. Here's a question. Say I develop this great new encryption system, and I want to sell my software worldwide. The thought police then come in and say "This algorithm is a threat to national security. You will not be permitted to export it." At this point, what kind of trouble could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international customers anyway? Doug Holland	11
Doug Holland claims Tom Clancy has provided the recipe for nuclear bombs. Clancy himself says he has omitted certain crucial steps. Further, how do we know Clancy knows, rather than repeating what he's read or been told in the unclassified domain? On the other hand, when John Aristotle Phillips was a junior at Princeton trying to keep from flunking physics by doing a terrific term paper, his atom bomb design was good enough that it got classified. A few of the steps were derived from social engineering (e.g. the name of the explosive), but it was fundamentally sound (and DID get an A.) The Pakistan embassy also called him up trying to get a copy; at the time they were lobbying the US government to get some nuclear reactors for "purely non-military" electrical power generation.	11
I have seen various references to 'triple des' recently. Could anyone tell me what it is ? From context, I would guess that it means encrypting each block 3 times, with a different key each time, but I'd like to be sure. Replies by email preferred - our news is unreliable. Thanks, Richard -- -------------- PGP Public Key available on request -------------- -- -------------- PGP Public Key available on request	11
About 50 people so far have asked, "Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys, won't they be able to read all your future and past traffic?" There has been no response from NIST, NSA, Ms. Denning, Mr. Hellman, or anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer. This is troubling. Didn't NSA think about this? Or is it a feature, and they thought we wouldn't notice? I would have thought that by now they would have responded with something of the form, "Well, that won't be a problem because ...." Very curious.	11
How about half a friend? The Motorola Codex preliminary V.Fast modem (which you can by right now) does 24.4 kbps (raw) over standard phone lines. 28.8 kbps is what is usually claimed for the "final" v.fast, but you can't go out and buy that right now, the standard isn't done yet. Again, voice can be compressed quite well down to 4000 or 8000 bps depending on how good you want it to be, but that requires a DSP or a special ASIC to do in real-time.	11
What is the reason for the push on clipper? Two days after the lead story here in the Mercury Times (murky news) there was another article on industrial espionage by the french. Someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have continued access to our communications, they already have it. The problem is that, yes the do have access, and probably more than we realize. The government wants exclusive access to communications intercept here in the united states, cutting out other access detrimental to the national security (tm). I also doubt that a certain3 letter agency, that originated the encryption algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the escrow system to continue their intercept effort.	11
So, who is Mykotronx, Inc.? It would be nice to know that they were not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government. Trusting the fox to guard the chickens, and all that. Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes. While we are at it, the chip design(s) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon, regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm. It would be a shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip, when all I'd know is that someone rang, and when I attempted to go off hook the line went dead. Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect directly to a modem. The design examination should be done to the gate level. Does anyone have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon? The model would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function. Tip offs would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence is not right. I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used, and its possible that might be noticed, but could be edited from the netlist. I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated. Imagine a design done in two layer metalization, yet finding a third layer under the microscope.	11
There is an article in Communications Week (April 12's issue) which states definitively that not only is the justice department trying to revive the "wiretapping bill", but they are ALSO trying to find a way to force key registration. CLIPPER is an obvious thrust in exactly this direction. Dorothy Dennings is quoted in this missive. Communications Week, April 12th, page 8. Read it and get peeved folks. Then ACT NOW or lose your fundamental right to privacy. Clinton has shown us that his only interest in this has to do with abortion, and not the right of all citizens to be secure in their papers and effects.	11

Hmmm.... CELP takes up about 12.6 MIPS for full duplex, and has been implemented on about a million DSP chips... the 56001 card in my PC only cost about $700, and I'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop. The Analog Devices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500 (academic price). I don't think hardware is something to worry about... if you get it working, people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow. What we need here is a good implementation of CELP (the government code is absolute crap, I got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours), and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames every 30msec... I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this (50MIPS). As part of the project I'm working on now, we're trying to get CELP up and running in realtime full duplex mode... I gotta find the source to pgp and see how tough it would be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code. I'll play with it.

Some politicians may not even wait a few years... Escrowed keys would have the same assurances of security. Besides, if someone wants to snoop, how are YOU to know - you don't think they will send you a letter saying "We are now snooping on your private conversations...", do you?

It depends on the mode you're using. For a single 64-bit input block, a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into a random number. If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the one 64-bit block will be affected. The next block, and all that follow it will be decrypted properly. It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely.	11

Right. People here believe the government is listening in on everything. Sure. If you can't provide an answer, change the assumptions to something you can deal with. It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's a matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in. Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a mall, the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search, and acquires your name. It's a matter of any number of possible wiretap abuses that cryptology makes far less likely, and this chip can sabotage. Par for the course, though. I predicted that you'd be jumping in in favor of this. The reply was that you'd justify anything up to and including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a written policy statement. Perhaps a little extreme, but not much.	11
Me too. A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in the sand. How many people do you want jailed for their convictions, for their insistence on real privacy?

All we're doing here is exercising our (so-called, rapidly narrowing) right to free speech. Perhaps you should talk to the government about that. Or are you a disciple of David "The cops are our FRIENDS" Sternlight?

I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed an interesting omission from the discussion. You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software. The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips and reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/ analysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips that we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was. I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities and that the potential is there, especially at a university where the security at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipper apart and analyze it? What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??	11
Well, actually, this one's easy. It's their job. The NSA is supposed to develop cryptosystems. If the government chooses to go ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it. This sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry for justice. These guys are way out on a limb, if I read that right. They've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been made public. What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide rule and a pencil? If they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors, I'd feel kinda sorry for 'em. Still do, a little.	11
This is stupid. Won't it cost more to those companies hoping to serve the gov't and private markets if they DON'T use the same technology?	11
I was annoyed to find that this guy posted my private e-mail response to him, but since I believe what I said, I'll defend it anyway. By "almost" I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack. The chosen plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if I understand the situation correctly. This is certainly a "break" under the meaning of the Act, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch. The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and observe the results. I wish him joy of it, and choose not to try that attack. I am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard. However, I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons, since that weakens the case against it. I said (in my private e-mail): No, it's quite different. The government would have no percentage in choosing F to be a weak key, since it's not to their advantage to have anybody else know it. The "experts" could thus assume that F is no worse than anything else during their analysis. Totally different situation from unknown S-boxes. Again, I'm not saying it would be good or satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and so on -- simply that I doubt that they <would> be given all the information.	11
Better yet: act. John	11
You obviously haven't read the information about the system. The chips put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow themselves to be identified. The system does not rely on registering people as owning particular phone units. I am against the proposal, but lets be accurate in our objections. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com	11
Great slogan! I'm ready to sign up with a crypto-lobbying effort (though I wouldn't want to do it through an NRA offshoot). Shall we also push for the CRA -- Cryptographic Rights Amendment ??	11
(alt.security.clipper added, to keep them informed of this issue) .... : The proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you : and don't charge you with a crime within, say, 90 days, they have to buy you : a new phone. : : If they do charge you, and you are found innocent, they have to buy you a : new phone. : : :-) Yes, but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose key they obtained? It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was silent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been obtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by the FBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previous conversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowing the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the security. No doubt more details will emerge.) So, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot more than merely replacing the phone. Sort of like saying to someone, "Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buy you a new one." And the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make such storing of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, the transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone listening, a kind of "Caller ID" and "Callee ID" on a grand scale. Also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless encrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach, I know, suggesting that the Clipper will make security more lax...). Anyway, still lots of issues unresolved. -Tim May	11
brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate. It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents decides they'd rather stop offering the service. I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government, then the contract for providing escrow service would include some termination clause like returning the keys. But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service? If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government. If the user is the buyer, what's the service? Keeping the key for me? No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service! Not telling everybody my key? Sounds like blackmail! If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine - I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key! Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want. The only people who want it are the government, not the users. What you're really talking about is either the government paying for the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes, or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax (forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.) I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency. Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees. There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective. If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee. Something could scratch the paint, after all. And what a shame if your Clipper key got out!	11
Some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages somehow if non-escrowed crypto goes away. A little perspective might be in order. The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. Law enforcement has to present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of authorizations. Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor recorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to: a) Have a pretty good reason, with evidence; b) Use this sparingly on highest priority "pretty good reasons." Though the system may be imperfect, it is a long way from the horror stories some here seem to believe or anticipate.	11
You can find what you're looking for on hundreds of sites worldwide. Try anonymous ftp to nic.funet.fi (Finland) /pub/unix/4.3bsd/net2/lib/libc/gen/crypt.c.Z This includes source code for fully-functional DES encryption and decryption. There are some who believe that public domain code is exportable, some who don't. Make your own judgements, but it seems obvious to me.	11
But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping. The actual wiretapping will, presumably, be conducted by the FBI. Of course, the capability for this was provided by the NSA, but I think that they are still within the limitations of their charter. I realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion. Although I don't care for Clipper and won't support or use it, I don't see the NSA as having overstepped their bounds.

You should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence your congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest rung of the opinion ladder. If you want to write (and I think you should!), take the time to really *write* a letter. Things to emphasize: - It's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical elite', i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi- ties. Emphasize that you are part of the group that will be making/developing/using Clinton's 'data superhighway.' - Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing and data communications. (if this is the case; don't call your- self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.) This will distinguish your letter from the random flamers. Don't turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the technical sides of the issue. - Don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook. Remember, your letter will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may even be a college student; if they don't understand it, your views won't even make the 'running total' sheets. - Be concise; don't ramble. Rants are *definitely* out of place. Cite references, if necessary, but only use "accepted" references like academic journals. "My neighbor Jim" is *not* a real refer- ence. 8) - Unfortunately, very few Congresscritters *really* understand electronic communications. Encourage them to pick up access to Compuserve, America Online, or one of the Free-Nets. Offer to send them samples. If you are in a position to do so, offer them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your systems. Offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in town. Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them *will* give your opinions more credence. - In addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing with the issue. If your Congresscritter isn't on the committee, they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor. --Wes ps> I'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the more traditional media, but Usenet doesn't have a decent track record in the analogy department. 8)	11
Good idea, But why put all the eggs in one basket? Given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks, why not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to be guarded better than Fort Knox. Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping. The USA has over 10,000 banks and thrifts - there are not likely to be more than 2,000,000 Clipper phones sold.	11
There's been some discussion very recently as to whether the government once again might exempt themselves from something they use to screw us over... Well, from comp.dcom.telecom: From: lesreeves@attmail.com Subject: Odds 'n Ends in the News * The Clipper Chip device introduced yesterday by AT&T may not be suitable for government use, says House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman Markey.

Markey has ordered Brown to answer several questions about security and cost concerns by April 28. (Communications Daily, 4/20/93)	11

I've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available in some form on EBCDIC machines. The message authentication would be ugly, but I think at least the IDEA encryption could work, if PGP had a switch to tell it to use IDEA in OFB-mode or ECB-mode. In OFB-mode, errors in translating EBCDIC-->ASCII-->EBCDIC would only affect their byte, not the 16 bytes that would be affected under CBC. Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes? I don't recall notincing it in the executable, but I haven't gone through it as carefully as I probably should....	11

I just signed up for this group, so I hope I'm not missing something in a FAQ, but I'm looking for a good introduction to the mathematics of encryption -- particularly DES and Public-Key, though others would be interesting also. Probably a good library could help me out, but I thought it might be even easier if I could obtain a nice article entirely electronically (besides, I have this rather *rational* phobia of libraries for reasons stemming from this "dissertation" thing hanging over my head :-)). I have a basic knowledge of mathematics... number-theory is a bit unfamiliar to me, but I've had a few graduate-level math courses in some other areas; anyway, I'm not a complete novice to the field. So probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level would be about right. Something, anyway, which is more specific than "a really big prime number is generated to code the message". If someone knows of a good text available by ftp (or gopher), or would like to email me one... please let me know. I'll probably keep reading this group; but it would be nice if you would email me at the same time, so I don't miss it. Thanx, Lulu...	11

Forwarded from libernet@dartmouth.edu: Date: Tue, 20 Apr 93 10:30:47 PDT From: ald@clipper.clipper.ingr.com (Al Date) Subject: "Clipper Chip" --NOT! To: libernet@Dartmouth.EDU Clipper TM chip is a registered trademark of Intergraph Corp. The so-called Clipper chip which was recently mentioned here and in other media with respect to encryption is being used in violation of that trademark. The Intergraph Clipper chip is a Unix microprocessor, originally developed by Fairchild Semiconductors, and has no relationship to the encryption chip whatsoever. I mention this here with the hope that someone reading this will intercede before the group alt.privacy."clipper" is established.	11
: In light of recent events, it may soon become a very good idea : to include the ability to produce transparent, or at least non-obvious, : cyphertext in upcoming revisions. This won't help if the NSA/FBA axis requires all messages to undergo textual analysis and reduction to canonical form to eliminate concealed messages. After reading several National Computer Security Center documents, I'm convinced that they are already using this filter. DoubleplusgoodNOT.	11
Motorola certainly makes them, but I don't know how you would go about buying one. You'd probably have to buy one of our secure radios. You could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country.	11
OK, Andrew, I'll provide some evidence. A friend of mine worked for an electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products. This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with DES. Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to "knock it off". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable business with the federal government. Now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they even know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp- tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the government's cease-and-desist demand? The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings of the law. I'll say "no thanks" to Clipper, or anything else the government produces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.	11

Maybe so, but it's quite common. There are millions of Macintosh users who have no idea what's in Apple's patented ROMs. Many have modems connected. How do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen? Answer: 1. Because you trust Apple; 2. Because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it would destroy Apple's credibility forever. In the Clipper case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed to audit it, and we'll have assurances (maybe even from the President) that other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors. While some may not have confidence in that (I am not among them), it's a lot more assurance than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life. David	11
You would have to use something other than the AT&T black box - in other words, I don't think public key would work.

Pat Myrto says if law enforcement wants keys, let them get a court order and then ask him for them. Most use of probably cause wiretapping warrants isn't to decrypt historical traffic, but for prospective listening once probably cause is established. Pat's approach would tip off the crooks.

I've been reading the sci.crypt, alt.privacy.clipper and comp.org.eff.talk discussions about the Clipper chip and find (as usual) that most of us think alike -- so there's a lot of repitition. If each of these messages were sent to Clinton as well as to the net (or instead of to the net), we might actually have some effect. 0005895485@MCIMAIL.COM (White House)	11

My original post was: This article will just scratch the surface of a few security considerations, comments are requested. (email: fw@world.std.com) My thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from Oracle Corp. The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit features or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$ included suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to use table views to refine the granularity of access control. One important security consideration in networked installations is that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user authentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the _least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably not define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access of OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle servers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv option), while relying on host security for local processes. Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and data access. These tools can be used to track the primary security risks from within the Oracle environment. Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES encryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone to cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate since the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users choose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access to your oracle database files through the host operating system, s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords. As security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity. Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files, s/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break the passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without alerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail which would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix) provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not guessable. As with all computer security, the most important defense is to educate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, (both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System Security (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992)	11
nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu correctly states Jerry Berman's 1985 view on privacy, but he mistakenly assumes that this represents Berman's 1993 view as EFF Executive Director. As one of the people who convinced Jerry that legal protections for privacy are insufficient, and that technical measures, especially public key cryptography, are also vitally necessary, I can tell you that Jerry and EFF are fully committed to this position. The previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of EFF positions in support of this view. I suggest those interested read EFF's position on Clipper or our other work in digital privacy. Check ftp.eff.org for more details. One of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change and evolution in their thinking. The idea that crypto is critical to privacy is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados, but is spreading to parts of the public policy community in Washington.	11
The *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys. The ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on the secrecy of the algorithm. To spell it out, because so many people seem to miss the point, if the algorithm were published, anyone could create a chip which would work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which would not have its key registered. I believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the government maintaining a secret of some kind. For example, the secret could be the private keys of the escrow agencies; their digital signatures would be required before a key could be used. In this case, the NSA/NIST/whoever has decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than other possible protocols.	11
I never advocated not saying what you believe in. I'm advocating second thought, and calm. "A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield" "A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield" "The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield" Think about it.	11
Unlike the CIA, the NSA has no prohibition against domestic spying. Read Bamford's THE PUZZLE PALACE.	11
: : As a private citizen, I would feel much more "secure in my person and : papers" knowing that an organization committed to individual civil : liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of : my key. Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure : by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported, funded, or : overtly controlled by the government. : -------------------------- Thats one problem that has so far been overlooked. These two escrow agencies will have to create a secure database and service the input and output of Keys. Who pays for this? If they refuse an illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their budget by cut to punish them? Will congress be forced to fund them forever? The problem is that laws can change. Congress may pass a law setting up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. Some future congress may change that law. Suppose pre-nazi Germany had a clipper system. Do you think the escrow agencies would have told Hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid court order? In effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance. They will be able to directly tap into Federal funds with no accountability to anyone except through a court challenge.	11
I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about cryptography, but a couple things came to mind while reading through the posts. 1. Is the Clipper chip going to be exported? If not, how will people communicate with other countries? Will they have to do that in un-crypt-mode. Will other encryption techniques be legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when going overseas, but not within the states? 2. I've read about authentication systems that use an electronic security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted PIN based on the time/date. The host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user. Is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time? The systems would then allow a "window" of time around this instant where the key would work. I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just keys. But for smaller scale things it might work. Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week (for instance). If further surveilance was needed, they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key. This would make it useless for local police to database keys they have used. I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the message. But any thoughts on the subject? Thanks, Tauren Mills	11
Thank you Andrew. Not only for the firm rebuttal, but for understanding the difference between communism and socialism (even though this is off topic). Why do people just not understand that just because all those pretty songs about the land of the free and so on sound nice, that they may not be true? Take off those rose colored glasses and get a clue (to use two of the better cliches around) thanks you again jamie	11
Given that certain archival methods have certain key(cleartext) in a file I used a programatic dictionary attack. I used the DES library provided with the system that I was using. What is to keep anyone from being lucky with a key? My previous employment has nothing to do with my current address, other than the fact that the fastest machine in the office was an IBM RISC System/6000 model 530, with 16 meg of memory.(not a super-computer) I really think this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key by the interface(ascii char/no padding), and most programs don't bother to clear off the archival front and backend ID's. Yes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time, can crack most of todays real world encryption. I sure that you or I could select a key, and prepare the data inorder that the decryption will become a worst case. but that is not the real world, and I'm sure that is how any agency would start an attack on a message, as you pointed out, there are some very good recognition algorithms availible, I'm just not familiar with them.

You're blowing smoke. Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas markets like Japan and the EC. The government told them "don't do encryption if you ever hope to export this technology". The reason that CDMA doesn't have encryption is NOT because the G-men came a'knocking at Qualcomm's door. It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular is big enough for them. This is just the International Traffic in Arms Regulations all over again. If you don't believe me, call Qualcomm and ASK THEM. Don't just throw out conspicracy theories. At least, don't do it on sci.crypt--there are whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap. Hah. They're not that much more expensive. Besides, if a drug dealer can afford a Rolex and a Mercedes, he can darn well afford Cylink phones. No, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export. Qualcomm isn't. So Cylink makes money--that's capitalism, comrade. "Someone" this and "someone" that. If you think it's so easy, why are you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it? Your name would become known and loved by dozens! But no, that would require actual EFFORT.	11
:I tried this code yesterday. On my Sparcstation ELC it takes over :300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech. This means that it :needs to be "optimized" by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable :in even a half-duplex mode. Ouch! Thanks for trying it. :I question whether CELP is the best approach for this application. It produces :great compression but at the expense of tremendous CPU loads. We want :something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end PC's :without DSP cards. My guess is that some other algorithm is going to be :a better starting point. Yes. I'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but I've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample) plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into 14.4K with a simdgen left over. This is *definitely* worth working on, folks. And shorten works in well under real-time.	11

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- [...] [...] As far as I can see, no matter how the session keys are generated (be it Diffie-Hellman or whatever), any Cripple conversation which travels in whole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme. Law- enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco, or illegally by finding some part of the phone line that they can cut into. The degree of risk depends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street, but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord's ranch). The only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all of them) - totally impractical, even if some part of the Cripple algorithm could be used as a kind of public key (I don't understand enough about these things to know). This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link, and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone. Gosh, yet another way to get round Cripple encryption. How many is that we've found so far? And that's without even knowing the details of the algorithm. - --Paul -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: 2.2	11
The Shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around 25kbps. We are rapidly approaching it. The fastest affordable full-duplex modems currently on the market are V32bis, which is 14400bps. CELP manages to sound decent at 4800 bps. In theory, if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice into ASCII, and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that sounded just like the person you were speaking to, you could get it down to the information content of the speech. With various kinds of LPC, you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps even less, at which point it sounds horrible. 4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes. -- Perry Metzger pmetzger@shearson.com	11
Since you asked, the above is a bit inaccurate. More accurate is that the government says its solid, other people in the field who might be able to find out haven't yet done their review of the chip design, and there's been a lot of wild speculation and guesswork from those with little information that it might be Swiss cheese. David	11
I believe it is illegal to send any cryptographic code out of the country without an export license. (Others will correct me if this is inaccurate.) Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only way to find out is to apply for a license. Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send if you don't.	11
I believe it's legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada with no export license. I think this is the only place you can do this - all other countries require a license. As an aside, I've always thought it should be legal to send DES software anywhere, if you follow these rules: 1. Encrypt your DES software with DES. 2. Send the encrypted software to the recipient. 3. Send the key to the recipient. The only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if he/she already *has* DES available - otherwise, they can't decrypt your program, and it is useless. If you've guaranteed they already have DES, have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of your program?? I'm sure it's still illegal, but it seems like a good idea...	11

The government decided to "discourage" them. You're blowing smoke. Qualcomm wants to sell to nice, lucrative overseas markets like Japan and the EC.

It's because Qualcomm doesn't think that the US market for digital cellular is big enough for them. This is just the International Traffic in Arms Regulations all over again. Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas, and the government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export, so he's only blowing the same smoke you are :-) Sure, they probably could have made a US version, and a non-crypto export version, and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to develop an overseas crypto ROM, but that's getting pretty expensive. No, Cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different stuff for domestic use vs. export. Qualcomm isn't. So Cylink makes money--that's capitalism, comrade. Well, some people like capitalism, and others prefer free enterprise; they're different! Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist. >Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this. Better yet, >prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a >sound card into a secure phone. "Someone" this and "someone" that. If you think it's so easy, why are you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it? Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do; writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill. Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized, but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff. Once the 586/Pentium becomes widespread, or the next generation of sound boards has DSPs on it, I suspect we'll see it happen. Maybe the vanilla 486+Soundblaster is enough.	11
>I'm afraid this doesn't work either. We can pick up laptop screens without any >problem. [...] I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip. If that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller. Can anybody verify or refute this? Yes, that's true. TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques you know to separate out the interesting stuff. The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully, you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked Chevy Step-Van. Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse. In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is paging out to disk, etc. With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to isolate the fun parts. TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels. But "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said.	11

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today's modems. This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device, compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device. The compressed, encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s (!). My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days, certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity (audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible). I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results. Remember, though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved. The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de, I believe (look for gsm or toast). I used Eric Young's DES implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch, it seems clear that one of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the Judicial Branch. I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, the Courts of Appeal. More specifically, the offices of their Clerks. Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations. Some of these records are confidential. So the concept of a court holding information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents. The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be. So judicial control of keys is appropriate. For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, the General Accounting Office. The GAO is Congress's staff unit for keeping tabs on the Executive Branch, and has an excellent reputation. It's controlled strictly by Congress; the Executive Branch has no authority over it. With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches, we might have a chance of this system working honestly. If, of course, a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before they reach the repositories. This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the whole Clipper concept. But if we have to have it, splitting control across all three branches of government might make it work.	11
I don't think mr. Clinton can even understand the technical details of the clipper encryption scheme.

Yes, you can use a stream cipher chip to hash data with only slight modification. See: `A fast cryptographic checksum algorithm based on stream ciphers', X Lai, RA Rueppel, J Woolven, Auscrypt 92 pp 8-7 to 8-11.	11
Do not presume to tell me what I have and have not read. The system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow. This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's coercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone. I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument. The original title perhaps should have been "Distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful", but "Clipper considered harmful" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context. Assumptions: 1. Clipper is made available. 2. Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system). These laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such detection a cause for further action. 3. For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal. This means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database. An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a red flag. 4. To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof and much less spoofable than today's cellphones. 5. Criminals want inscrutable communications. Some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably legitimate) wiretap order exists. They will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because each one has a unique unit key. 6. Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves. Because they are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable/tappable channel. They know that do so would raise a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under immediate suspicion. 7. It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F, and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip. By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper phone without immediate detection. Because it is difficult to obscure one's association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else. A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure communications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow, or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T. The encrypted communications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later, but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before T elapses. It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper phone to someone else. The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone else's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion. This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion and collusion. Coercion first. Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation). Criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor criminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals. Someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage. The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones. There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money, and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper phone service for someone else's use. Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal cellphone. They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to their stolen phone) this way. The fact of a phone's use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and have its keys obtained from escrow. Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption. An automated full-system surveillance mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F, can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys, which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces, upon specific wiretap-like order. Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper medium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk recordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper chip is fractured. If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be using someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning. You will not even be able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow. The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than they were before Clipper came along. I therefore consider Clipper harmful because: 1. It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government. 2. If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public. 3. It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress. 4. If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against. 5. If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting of "illegal" cipher use. Because any computer can be used as a cipher machine...	11
Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece "New Encryption" to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company, Secured Communications Technologies, Inc, and on encryption algorithm, NEA. I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot of ground. Some of the information in the posting requires some clarification, and I would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci.crypt. SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland. Our two main products at this time are a PC based secure communications program called SECOM and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM. SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link between two PC's connected over dial up telephone lines. It supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen "chat". It has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption. All though it is a packetized link, the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden. When SECOM was initially developed, it was implemented to use DES encryption. A business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity. We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general export approval for anything using DES. All though the reason for this was never explicitly stated, it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect. In any event, the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of DES. This was the reason NEA (New Encryption Algorithm) was born. At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret. The preliminary work of patenting it has begun, and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete. All though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret, I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people "shoot at it" over an extended period of time to prove its worth. In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA, it was necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm. This was done only AFTER we had a finished product to submit. Let me state unequivocally that there is NO "back door" to the program or the algorithm. Secured Communications Technologies is a closely held private company and NSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved. From a practical business standpoint, we are interested in selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a back door to the encryption, if found out, could destroy our credibility and our business. With the encryption algorithm approved for export, we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems. We were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements. This led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm "cast in silicon" and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified. We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips. In a press release today, our president, Dr. Stephen Bryen stated: "It seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American Public. But do we not understand how the National Security Agency, which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying, can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying activities."	11
Good points. In addition, I would point out that now is one of the best times to fight this political battle, with much of the opposition in disarray -- an FBI director (Sessions) on his way out, an Attorney General (Reno) who has only been in long enough to find the office coffee machine two tries out of three (and, between slow confirmations and Clinton's Saturday Night Massacre, hasn't much of a staff in place). If we really get lucky, both of the above will be too busy trying to keep their feet from being held to the Waco fire to spend much effort insisting on their alleged right to spy on the American people.	11

Of course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K. Can anybody verify this ? Did I do anything wrong ? Thanks.	5
Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify a color for drawing, like Drawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or Fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) With X, I have to do something like XSetForeground(current_color) XDrawPoint(d,w,x,y) Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the display it is being drawn on?	5
It's actually a bug in the Solaris 2.1 kernel.

The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial widgets is the ICS Widget Data book. ICS sells the widgets for various prices. There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets such as those used in dataviews. I dont know there pricing schemes but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their databook catalog and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there) I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them. hope this helps you. -- Brian Dealy |301-572-8267| It not knowing where it's at dealy@kong.gsfc.nasa.gov | | that's important,it's knowing !uunet!dftsrv!kong!dealy | | where it's not at...

Hello X'ers I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The following code illustrates the problem: #include <stdio.h> #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <X11/Xutil.h> main() { Display *display; Window win; XVisualInfo vinfo; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; XEvent event; Status status; display=XOpenDisplay(NULL); status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor, &vinfo); if (!status){ fprintf(stderr,"Visual not found\n"); exit(1); } colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display), vinfo.visual,AllocNone); attributes.colormap=colormap; win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100, 0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes); XMapWindow(display,win); for (;;){ XNextEvent(display,&event); } } I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP 9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change), both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request. As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the same error. Karsten --	5
I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to: :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution. However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely. After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize. I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it. Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path, the results are inaccurate. I do have some Speedo fonts, but not for the family I am using (Helvetica). I think this is incorrect. The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display. This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres! This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts! For instance, the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font). The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path). Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me! Unless I my applications specifies a resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default. Is this a bug? Is it a feature? If so, why? Is there anything I can do to get around this problem? People have suggested that I lie about my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both). This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats an inch".

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas. here's a small piece of code that uses those routines static void Redisplay(pw, ev, region) XtpManagerWidget pw; XExposeEvent *ev; Region region; /* pp->exposure_region is an XRegion */ XtpManagerPart *pp = &pw->plotter; pp->exposure_region = XCreateRegion(); /* region is passed via an expose event */ if(region == NULL) { if (ev->send_event) /* synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw*/ { exporect.x = pw->core.x; exporect.y = pw->core.y; exporect.width = pw->core.width; exporect.height = pw->core.height; } else { exporect.x = ev->x; exporect.y = ev->y; exporect.width = ev->width; exporect.height = ev->height; } stuff deleted /* region now contains the exposure region */ XUnionRectWithRegion(&exporect,pp->exposure_region,pp->exposure_region); } else XUnionRegion ( region, pp->exposure_region, pp->exposure_region); stuff deleted /* WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID */ XSetRegion(XtDisplayOfObject(pw), pp->plotarea_gc,pp->exposure_region); stuff deleted /* check to see if child is exposed */ if (XRectInRegion (pw->plotter.exposure_region, child->core.x , child->core.y , child->core.width , child->core.height )) So, I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container widget redraw of rectobj children, I only redraw what need to be redrawn.

I am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux system. - It must be free. - It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600) No motif/openlook etc. - It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps. - It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable). I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are. - ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows. - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects. - support for texts in any size. - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing. - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle) - any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing. - less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection. If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing, stay connected. Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it. I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X?	5

Hi ppl, I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine. I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr. My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :) There's still a little problem I can't solve however: I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets. The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work. I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does. Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry "Mode_switch" which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd?? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't. If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them, help would be appreciated. CU	5

One way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the show_mouse_position function. If the XEvent arrive in this function as XEvent p_event; then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the value of the pressed button.	5
In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests; that is, the server's drawing model was stateless. This caused problems with performance and network traffic, so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state. Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in each drawing request.	5
I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed API to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...) Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there anybody has done some similar jobs ? By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button.... That will be great if someone can share us what you have done. Thanks in advance.	5
Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion. First get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it. It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the page, and maintains page counts. I've written a little C program to massage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you can get all the ascii strings in the document. No guarantees that it won't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying degrees of success. Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want. /* * massager: a filter for use with gs; does crude Postscript->ASCII conversion * * Usage: * cat file.ps | gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps - | massager * * I print a <Ctrl-L> after each new page. * * Put the following source into massager.c and compile it: */ #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> main() { char line[1000], *p; while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) != NULL) if (line[0] == 'P') printf("\f\n"); else if (line[0] == 'S' && line[1] == ' ') { if ((p = strrchr(line, ')')) == NULL) continue; *p = '\0'; if ((p = strchr(line, '(')) == NULL) continue; for (p++; *p; p++) if (*p != '\\' || (p[1] != ')' && p[1] != '(')) putchar(*p); putchar('\n'); } return(0); }	5

I'm running xterm under X11R5, Motif 1.1, mwm and UNIX SVR4 on a UNISYS 386 based machine. My default shell is /bin/csh or the C shell. Whenever I run xterm, I get the following message before the first C shell prompt: Warning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell... After this, I can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. Also, I can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (I can only launch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu). I'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where I can get some help. By the way, my environment variable TERM is set to xterm. ---------------------------- Saad Mufti Personal Library Software	5
Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System. The X Window System Conference remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X. Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers. Add vendor exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11. Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, Doug Young, and many others. Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional conferences. Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest. These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational; and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT. With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be evaluated. As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and suppliers. The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner. The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that. We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT. If you aren't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is the place to find out. Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you what you need. Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself. I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an Xhibition commercial:-). I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it. The industry is a confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of the other acronyms sprouting up. Xhibition can help sort out the confusion. -Aub Harden Technical Program Manager harden@ics.com X H I B I T I O N The Conference and Trade ****** ***** Show for Corporate * * * Software Development ****** *** * * 201 Broadway *** ***** Cambridge, MA 02139 Windows on Distributed Computing June 7 - 11, San Jose, CA xhibit@ics.com uunet!ics.com!xhibit Voice: (617) 621-0060 Fax: (617) 621-9555	5
REPOST: I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure events are handled. I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method. The rescale method invokes a "fake" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data. Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed. I assume I'm getting cascading events. Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way? Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever. Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5? Thanks in advance	5
After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing: 1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation problem. 2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find to meet your requirements. This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin: -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you. You should try to always use known pixel sizes.	5

Hi, I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running SunOS 4.1.1. Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file. With xdm, the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm root-window nor my applications know about these variables. I used the "DisplayManager._0.userPath" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config to succesfully pass the PATH variable. But I am having problems passing anything else!!! I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession but that didn't help. I also tried using "DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH" which didn't work either. I would appreciate any help on this matter. Thanks in advance, Shash	5
Greetings, I need some help with the detail of geometry specification. I have a program that uses Xlib to create a simple window. I tried to hard code the x,y location in XCreateWindow but it didn't work. I also tried XSetStandardProperties, XSetWMHints with no luck. Could somebody enlighten me on this subject. Hans.	5
Sorry, that's a feature. The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it. If this bothers you, complain to the app writer. Write your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM. Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title. The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.	5
How can I capture ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events in multiple clients? I want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen. I can get KeyPress/KeyRelease and Pointer motion events, but if the user is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move) I can't capture the events. The O'Reilly Xlib Programming Manual (vol. 1) says on page 252; "Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, due to the grab that automatically takes place." Any help would be appreciated.	5
We are planning on buying 15-20 X Terminals. I have the article from Jim Morton regarding prices, etc., and am looking for any other information that will help me decide which to buy. The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM, running OSF/1. From what I have found out so far, it would be best to run as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm, etc.), and that in order to do this we need n Mb RAM in the Xterminal (where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to). What should I be looking for? What sort of questions should I be asking the salespeople? Thanks	5

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z. We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned. You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver- tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking, set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough advertising. I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to X10). The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused. Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it's mapped. As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work. But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version. As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line of code). I'll put this on export today. Michael	5

I've been able to configure xterm so that I can type in accented characters.

Hi, I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events, so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in some sort of 'preferences' file. I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell: XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData); This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager (mwm). However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the XEvent passed to the event handler callback. I'm accessing the xconfigure structure, like the X11 manual says. (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y). The width and height memebers are correct. When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings. Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero? Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes? I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values for the x, y, width, height resources. Thanks --	5
Hi Xperts! How can I move the cursor with the keyboard (i.e. cursor keys), if no mouse is available? Any hints welcome. Thanks.	5
From my own notes on this subject.... Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another. This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used. 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on... (the method in the xauth manual) Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands. xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge - This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence (EG: xauth add $auth) Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required. The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also pass environment variables, as well as the current directory. You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories. WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended. The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from the view of other users. 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable. This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly. A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your authorization. On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or stty'ing your terminal. ---8<--- script for launching rlogin: #!/bin/sh # ~/bin/rl --- Rlogin with display: if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then case "$DISPLAY" in :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;; esac TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`" export TERM fi rlogin $* ---8<--- add to your .cshrc or .login if ( $?TERM ) then if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge - setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f2` setenv TERM `echo "$TERM" | cut '-d&' -f1` endif endif ---8<--- xterm command to use xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname ---8<--- 3/ NFS. Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to. Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE: login host: echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host remote host: setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host` 4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information. This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering the user. Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each individual. IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known by others, nor should it be easy to determine. A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone who is asking. This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but less secure.

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some information about the relative efficiency of different products. Are any notably efficient (fast)? Are any notably inefficient? I assume that a Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the Sparc10's console. What are the key ways of improving performance for PC (presumably Windows) clients? Also, what about async solutions? (Yes, I appreciate that it will be *much* slower even with V.42bis.) I'm in the process of installing PPP (with header compression). How does that compare to cslip? I've seen a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but are there comparable products out there? If we're looking for efficiency for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard PPP w/ compression and XRemote? Any information would be greatly appreciated. I'm still taking in all the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency of various product offerings would be great. (I get the impression that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.) Thanks. -- Rob	5

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text. It only supports 90 degrees rotation. Currently, it supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes. However, it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing. Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing. Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation. I was told that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet. It works with both color and monochrome X.	5

We have Suns running SunOS 4.1.3 and Openwindows 3.0 (X11R4).

I don't want to hardwire the UNIX xdm to manage the PC displays as the PC's are not always running Linux (let alone xfree86). I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision. Can anybody help? Thanks,	5
Is it possible to get an xterm scrollbar to come out on the right side instead of the left? Ron Shenk	5
Now available: xvertext 5.0 --------------------------- Another day, another xvertext release... Summary ------- xvertext provides you with several functions to draw strings at any angle in an X window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). What's new since 4.0? --------------------- o Existing bitmap fonts can be magnified to give reasonable fonts at large sizes. o Bounding boxes can be obtained. o The GC's stipple bitmap is honoured. o Font IDs can be cached when font names are unavailable. o An Imakefile is present. o The demos are better (including a ransom note like the comp.sources.postscript one) Where can I get it? ------------------- comp.sources.x (soon...) export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/xvertext.5.0.shar.Z (now)	5
I'm not familiar at all with the format of these "X-Face:" thingies, but after seeing them in some folks' headers, I've *got* to *see* them (and maybe make one of my own)! I've got "dpg-view" on my Linux box (which displays "uncompressed X-Faces") and I've managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that I'm *looking* for them, I can't seem to find any X-Face:'s in anyones news headers! :-( Could you, would you, please send me your "X-Face:" header? I *know* I'll probably get a little swamped, but I can handle it. ...I hope.	5
You should try having a .xsession script in $HOME to do these things. xdm will start up your process using the system version (usually /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession), which should check whether you have your won and change to that if you do. (Take a copy of the system one and edit it). Note, that this file requires "x" access to be set.	5
Or the library might be there but not pointed to by LD_LIBRARY_PATH.	5
Check into the vopl and vogle libraries. I beleive that I still have them available on ftp.c-mols.siu.edu but I'm not sure. I haven't seen any new announcements for the software but I'm sure it's still around. I have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as just for producing graphs after the fact. It works well and supports numerous graphics output formats (including X.) I tried it and liked it. YOu may as well.	5
specify RamdomPlacement (or RandomPlace ? ) in your .tvtwmrc. This places the windows not-interactively in pseudo - random positions on your screens.	5
Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the liberty of responding to some of this. If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support@qdeck.com. A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run. How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it. I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like "Smoking Clover" would make the link useless for anyone else. On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much. In the real world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes. Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people. Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other. The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave. The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server. As I warned you, this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link. Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent. Let's break it into pieces and look at it. Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic. Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be. Does the server that it's displaying on have backing store? If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up? If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily. If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit. DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted. Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent. Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds. In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls. X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network. It's pretty good for this. X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost as good (since we conert them to X easily). Something like WinX is a hybrid. We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X. The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network. We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us.	5
Hi All, This is the first time I've posted to the net, so I hope this is going to the right people. I'm looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC. The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by process Engineers at work. If anyone can E-Mail me any recommended packages/horror stories/etc I would be greatful. Thanks in advance Mark Wilkinson	5

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) ===================================================================== I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system? 1. Free options The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will be more difficult to compile. Information on how to obtain XFree86 is listed below. X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4, X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more). X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below). 2. Commercial options 1) Metro Link 2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it? 3. What is XFree86? XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with X11R5. This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and other enhancements. Here are the highlights of the enhancements: 1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86, selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file. Some SpeedUps require an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of 1024. The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by default. With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2. 2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected. This mode is now equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately 20% faster than X386 1.2. 3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients, or both. This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4. For SVR4.0.4 with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported. 4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets. Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about the ATI and Trident drivers. 5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu). 6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is compile-time selectable. There are contributed Type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu. 7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions. 8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux. 9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA cards is now included. The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2 (they were not in XFree86 1.1): 1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 (see the X386(1) manual page for more information). 2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a "two headed" server - one VGA, and one Hercules. So far this has only been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux). 3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1. 4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for more information.) 5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some versions of these devices were not previously compatible). 6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation). 7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more information). 8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of 0.1 MHz. Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server. 9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig configuration file. Error messages are much more informative and intuitive, and more validation is done. There are many new options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) manual page for more information on the format of this file). Plus a number of other small things. Refer to the CHANGELOG file in the source distribution for full details. Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat. 4. What OSs are supported? XFree86 supports: SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2 SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2 Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1 BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>. Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, but anyone should feel free to submit patches. If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to xfree86@physics.su.oz.au 5. What video hardware is supported? At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets: Tseng ET4000 Tseng ET3000 Paradise PVGA1 Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of the PVGA1, and use its driver) Genoa GVGA Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 ATI 18800, 28800 All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 256 color mode. The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card. On the ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k. It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies. To avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock. This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered. Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how these programs work, if you need to write one. If you do develop such a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with future XFree86 releases. If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the Orchid ProDesigner IIs. Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details. In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond products, as long as such policies remain in effect. Contributions of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it. Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It could be ISA, EISA, or local bus. What should matter is the chipset on the video card. Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested theory. However, we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 working fine on them. 6. What about accelerated boards? At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc. This support is available in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4). An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux. Contact <hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux. A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86. 7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes? The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 16-color modes. In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel. But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes. Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes. The MIT frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this. If VGA handled 16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure). But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required. Some beta testers are looking into this, but nothing is yet available from the project. 8. What other hardware or software requirements are there? Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required. To run X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound. 9. Where can I get source for XFree86? Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from: export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) (For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP) Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution. 10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86? Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from: ftp.physics.su.oz.au - SVR4 binaries under /XFree86/SVR4 ftp.win.tue.nl - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 ferkel.ucsb.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 stasi.bradley.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 (ISC) binaries under /pub/ISC ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de - SVR3 (ISC) binaries under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 tsx-11.mit.edu - Linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/X11 agate.berkeley.edu - 386BSD binaries under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu - Mach binaries under /i386 Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well. Each binary distribution will contain a README file that describes what files you need to take from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution. IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86? 11. Installation directories The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot (/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}. This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation. 12. Configuration files The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ("Xconfig") on startup. The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions. 13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated occasionally. Obtain a copy of this database. It just might have the settings you need. If you create new settings, please send them to David for inclusion in the database. If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use this description to get them right. When you do, send the information to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database. NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and is completely unnecessary. If you need to determine dot clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server. The server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up starting the server in the future. 14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server. This is fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit. V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86? First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755). 15. SVR4 Why won't my xterm run properly? If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run. csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with XFree86. It recommended that this patch not be installed. Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap. 16. SVR3 Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running. 17. 386BSD Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD. Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu>. The latest version should be available in the file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites: agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18. Linux You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed. Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root. If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to run the server as "X -pn". The default startup configuration assumes that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the -pn argument to X386. Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but startx won't. When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with a tty, for example "xdm < /dev/console &". For more detailed information, please read the file README present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu. 19. Mach Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach. VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source? This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. Please look at those files for information on building XFree86. VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86? 20. BSD compatibility library A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include <X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them. Xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions. If you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a 21. ANSICCOPTIONS This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite the entire CCOPTIONS line. For example, with stock MIT, you'd see something like CCOPTIONS="-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings" and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" in his Imakefile. With this change, you would see a default of ANSICCOPTIONS="-ansi" CCOPTIONS="-O2 -fwritable-strings" and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is: ANSICCOPTIONS= to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death with -ansi). The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex. The other issue is that one must add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition. XFree86 Contact Information Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86 Core Team. At this time the Core Team consists of: The original "gang of four": David Dawes <dawes@physics.su.oz.au> Glenn Lai <glenn@cs.utexas.edu> Jim Tsillas <jtsilla@damon.ccs.northeastern.edu> David Wexelblat <dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com> Those supporting non-SYSV operating systems: Robert Baron <Robert.Baron@ernst.mach.cs.cmu.edu> [Mach] Rich Murphey <Rich@Rice.edu> [386BSD] Orest Zborowski <obz@kodak.com> [Linux] e-mail sent to <xfree86@physics.su.oz.au> will reach all of the core team. -------------------------------------------------- Thanks to all the people who already sent me corrections or additions, especially David Wexelblat (one of the major contributors of updates).	5
From the FAQ: Subject: 96)! What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]? In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably, to be undefined when building some X11 clients: _get_wmShellWidgetClass _get_applicationShellWidgetClass Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" appears to work. To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: Patch i.d.

--- Hello! We want to configure our X11R5 sytem (i486 33Mhz running BSD-like UNIX) comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then connect to them. But the only connection works is localhost! An 'X -indirect <machine>' works very well! The configuration: - starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified in Xservers - starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in Xacces bye '* CHOOSER <machine1> <machine2> ... BROADCAST - the number of users on this machines and the load is displayed correct - selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu appears again. I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5 Please help Lars -------------------------------------------------------------------------------	5
Try to run Xsun under truss(1). The best way to do this is by logging in over the network and typing: truss -t open Xsun open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) Err#2 ENOENT open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.dir", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi/fonts.alias", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/6x13.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 open("/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8 This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be. If you have defined a project root and done a make install, everything should have gone right by default, even without symbolic links.	5
I posted this May 12th: I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one here: Here's the ones I know of: Wind/U - Bristol Technologies Hunter SDK - Hunter Systems MainWin - MainSoft LIBWXM - Visual Solutions Hunter The company is going through some big changes. I expect to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name. At the moment, it is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info. Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. Visual Solutions LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about. They don't yet support MDI or MFC. Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical modeling package. Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol. Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info. She's very helpful. MainSoft This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at runtime. They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go straight to Xlib. They don't yet support MFC. They're at 415 896 0708. Bristol This company that seems to be on the right track. Wind/U uses Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app. They seem to be doing the most work in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon. My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles. They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.	5
I've found that I have to add the "-8" option for displaying JPEGs with the new version. For some reason, if I don't, it goes into 24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors (from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier. Since I'm on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it could tell that.	5
Is there a portable and convenient way to use color picture files in the .xpm format to define an X pixmap in a Motif application? Any functions, pointers, tips etc. would be most welcome. -------------------- Saad Mufti Personal Library Software	5
I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through the XView xv_get() function: x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X); y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y); For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame, XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out (by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What gives? Any help most appreciated! Derek P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around frames, etc.? -----------------------------------------------------------	5

same here I received similar information/advice about what appears to be the same problem Benjamin has (and I still have). NIS has all the information about the Macs (I even put explicit entries in /etc/hosts to no avail). Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic, the initial REXEC packet is sent to the the SUN, which sends something to the correct Mac, but nothing appears at the Mac. 'rexecd' is number one suspect, but it's more suble than the README suggests and I haven't yet looked into it further. -- callum.downie@brunel.ac.uk Faculty of Technology, Brunel University, Uxbridge, UB8 3PH, UK +44 895 274000 x2730	5
Take a look at TeleUSE, a complete UIMS from Alsys (formerly TeleSoft). In the US, you can reach them at (619) 457 2700. Alsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v2.0.5 for VMS V5.5 or higher, built using DECwindows Motif 1.0 (based on X11R4 and Motif v1.1.1). BTW, the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company, and was released in November 1992.	5
We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs. These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps: - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data otherwise block (new data comes quite often) - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often) - update the display according to latest data and messages. We typically have several of these running in windows, plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag. Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run. Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into. O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time. We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc. The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate. Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt. The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready. We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o. Any suggestions or examples most welcome! We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.	5
** I am posting this for a friend ** ** please respond to vaughn%sonatech@hub.ucsb.edu ** I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern of the GC. The following code segment almost works if the window width is an even multiple of 8. If it is not an even multiple it skews the pattern towards the right. Another problem, whether it is an even multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels apart. extern Display *dpy; extern Window xid; extern GC gc; extern int Max_X, Max_Y; /* set in resize handler */ dither(pixels) char *pixels; /* dither pattern data */ { char *bm; /* bitmap data */ char *bmp; long I, arraymax; arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y; bm = (char *)malloc(arraymax); bmp = bm; for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++) { if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT) *bmp |= 2<<j; /* pixel on */ else *bmp &= ~(2<<j); /* pixel off */ if (++j > 7) { bmp++; j = 0; } } stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y); free(bm); XClearWindow(dpy, xid); XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple); XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled); XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y); XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid); } I suspect the answer is to pad the data.	5
I've built xcoral on my system (SunOS 4.1.3, X11R5, Motif 1.2, OW 3.0) and it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral opens, 1) locks the mouse into the window area 2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse. Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an empty terminal to login and kill xcoral. Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif? Is there a patch? --- ####################################################################### # Bob Campbell # "Crayons can take you where no # # System Manager # Starship can go." # # HAO, NCAR # -Guinan # # rsc@hao.ucar.edu # STTNG # ####################################################################### DISCLAIMER: My views are in no way connected to my employer.	5
I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What is really powerful is that it can run the X server without running a window manager. One can then run a special client X program called a window manager, either (1) run motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook from some home place (like a sparc, or vms). This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager (without killing windows) and then start up another manager. (Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in one manager and not the other). Well the question is: On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run the window manager. --- Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the large volumes in window.X) Thanks.	5

Three q's: 1) is it reliable? 2) how does it send the information from a MS Windows app over the X11 protocol? Does it just draw everything as graphics into one window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work more cleverly? 3) If I want to run MS Word, for example, remotely, do I have to run a separate copy of MS Windows remotely, and then start MS Word from that, or can MS Word be started remotely on its own?	5
Hi there, I'm looking for tools that can make X programming easy. I would like to have a tool that will enable to create X motif GUI Interactivly. Currently I'm Working on a SGI with forms. A package that enables to create GUI with no coding at all (but the callbacks). Any help will be appreciated.	5
You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop. That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop. You can obtain the file descriptor of the X display connection using fd = ConnectionNumber (display);	5
NCD just announced a new generation of PC-Xview. They changed the name a little though and I can't remember exactly... PC-Xsomething.	5
Well that may be true. However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0 does not mention about DSC compliance. In any event, the point here is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will find out that it's not a practical tool.	5
Hi, netters: We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed by Sun) - namely Xos.h: #if !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__) # include <string.h> # define index strchr # define rindex strrchr #else /* BSD && !__STDC__ */ # include <strings.h> #endif /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist under Solaris2. We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code. We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem. In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's distribution) mentions this problem: BUGS If you do not have the source for cpp, the Berkeley C preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all #if directives will evaluate to "true" regardless of their actual value. This may cause the wrong #include directives to be evaluated. Makedepend should simply have its own parser written for #if expressions. Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.	5
If you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine). *BUT* your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone. (From experience). You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install. The performance will be at least four times better. In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use. On top of that they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card, very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole lot of $$$$). I can get 15" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance is over 80000 Xstones.....	5

As quoted from <1993May13.212321.2563@moepi.do.open.de> by bernward@moepi.do.open.de (Bernward Averwald): +--------------- The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also DESQview/X, which does this in its DOS windows). Do you really want xterm to wake up every half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt?	5
On the subject of ghostscript, it will also solve the earlier request of converting postscript to HPGL to filter into Interleaf.	5
When I changed from SVR4 to SVR4.2 on my Intel box I discovered that some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work. They bomb out with the message: error: can't open display unix:0.0 Is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need to be recompiled, or have I not used the correct options? Both systems use X11R5. Thanks.	5
I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler. I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit 720x280 display. The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd | xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be. However, the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long. After a bit of experimentation, it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which isn't exactly divisible by four. Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h: ---- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 32 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 5 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 --- to: --- #define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 16 #define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 4 #define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 --- Was not exactly the right solution. How do I tell the server either (a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte boundries? I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.	5
I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it. I'd like to have the R5 server recognize the second card. I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the server, the second device was ignored. How do I setup the second card? Note: If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the second card, and start a second window manager. Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone out there has seen this problem already... email is preferred... post if you must... Thanks in advance.... Jim	5
This discussion on viewing .ps files undex X11 seems rather interesting but I fail to understand the reason it is not contained in 2 at most newsgroups. I am subscribed to comp.text.interleaf and I could care less about .ps viewing under X11. I am sure that members of this group interested in the topic can followup by looking at other newsgroups. Could you please remove the comp.text.interleaf from your distribution? Just as a nettish sort of courtesy. Best regards. -- Leo J Irakliotis irakliot@longs.lance.colostate.edu	5
I am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse cursor enters a window in my application. I'm using InterViews, but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in X. For example, I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2, with point-to-focus set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell tool window to another. Or so it seems... My question, then, is what can I do within X to guarantee point-to- focus within my application? Thanks for any response.	5
Answers please by e-mail, since not all groups in the header are carried here. Hi! Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better than I like C++. But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want to do real work. Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews (what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I started with NeXTSTEP.) Thanks,	5

Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network. One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and hence process switches) that it forces upon a host. Actual measurements (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character.) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user. This is a significant increase in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working set. If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many as 50. If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!	5
I tried to send this as private mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was rejected, so here it is: Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX: Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine. This is due to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from requesting machines that are not known to the Sun|s network address (/etc/hosts or NIS hosts) database. To successfully use remote commands with a SunOS-based machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the Macintosh which is running MacX. --	5
Has anyone built Xkernel for 3/80's? It works great on our 3/50s, and I would just as soon kiss the entire Sun 3 architeture goodbye (and reclaim a bunch of disk space). Email me direct, I'll post a summary.	5
I'm posting this request again since the last one had no title. I'm looking for X server software on DOS or Windows. I've already seen Desqview/X and XVision but would like to be aware of other solutions, namely public domain or shareware implementations.

I for one am going, because I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance to learn about NT, mainly because: - It will be presented in X's "home turf". I believe that the attendees will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the NT presentations will face a tough audience. - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the time to do. - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to waste my time ... in California?!? :-) Just my thoughts... --	5
I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system). I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic. We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4. -- Regards, Martin	5
I just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from fisher@iscp.bellcore.com (Greg Fisher): He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely correct. Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks: Xmp/Table.c: void XmpTableNewProposedLayout( tw ) XmpTableWidget tw; { XmpTableConsiderSameSize( tw ); XmpTableProposedColsAndRows( tw ); XmpTableQueryParentForResize( tw ); /* query only, no resize */ /* * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue. * However, Motif is broken so that we actually may already have * been resized. In that case, the proposed layout is already * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit. */ if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest ) { XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth( tw ); XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw ); XmpTableGetProposedChildSize( tw ); XmpTableSaveProposedLayout( tw ); } /* else the resize has already been done. Our proposed layout would * have been forgotten in the process. */ } The XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names: Xp/Table.c: void XpTableNewProposedLayout( tw ) XpTableWidget tw; { XpTableConsiderSameSize( tw ); XpTableProposedColsAndRows( tw ); XpTableQueryParentForResize( tw ); /* query only, no resize */ /* * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue. * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may * already have * been resized. In that case, the proposed layout * is already forgotten, so we should just quietly exit. */ if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest ) { XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth( tw ); XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw ); XpTableGetProposedChildSize( tw ); XpTableSaveProposedLayout( tw ); } /* else the resize has already been done.

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process #if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are. [...] Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us? rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc -M' or 'gcc -M' or 'gcc -MM' (which is the one I prefer, since system headers don't change that often) for generating the actual dependencies. you'll still need to write the parts that edit the actual Makefile. I think there's a program in the Berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this.	5
I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s). The image is created using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage. The image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because the server on the other machine is using a different colormap. I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay, performed a table lookup against the new colormap. This didn't work because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap. Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or is there a simpler way to solve this problem? I tried using xinitcolormap but couldn't get that to work either. Any help would be appreciated.	5

Xsun won't come up in color w/ this framebuffer! I am trying to use xkernel on some of these 4/110s I have a freshly built Statically linkes copy of Xsun that works just fine on cg6, cg4, bw2 type of framebuffers, but on the 4/110 that have this type of frame buffer all I get is Mono. cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8 cgtwo0: Sun-3 color board, fast read Here is what I've tried. removing all the other /dev/cg* , /dev/bw , and /dev/fb and then selectivly recreating /dev/cgtwo0. Xsun comes up mono. recreating /dev/fb, comes up mono, I've tried Xsun & Xsun -dev /dev/cgtwo0. PS Xnews will come up in color but it's not statically linked, and the dynamically linked Xsun comes up in mono also.

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However, after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not happen when I use xscreensaver. My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this: xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 & My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session. However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is there a workaround? I'd prefer responses via e-mail. Thanks.	5

Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in. I've got a little problem. I finally managed to get a REAL operating system (Linux, as opposed to MS-Dos) and I like it alot. But, when I try to run 'startx', I get a strange response: My monitor goes into graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's all! Nothing else! Now, I've collected almost every FAQ in the world to help me but either it's too confusing or I must be missing something.

Hi! I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver. What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for some time. I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call xlock program. Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time? Or is there a way to find out how long the server has been idle?	5
The good news is we just got two Sparc10's. The bad news is that /dev/cgtwelve0 is apparently not supported in X11R4 or X11R5. Does anyone know of a patch (and how I can obtain it) to either X version that will enable us to use X11 on our Sparc10's?	5

--- Hello! We want to configure our X11R5 sytem (i486 33Mhz running BSD-like UNIX) comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then connect to them. But the only connection works is localhost! An 'X -indirect <machine>' works very well! The configuration: - starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified in Xservers - starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in Xacces bye '* CHOOSER <machine1> <machine2> ... BROADCAST - the number of users on this machines and the load is displayed correct - selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu appears again. I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5 Please help Lars -------------------------------------------------------------------------------	5
I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping is really just a mistake on my part. Does anyone know anything about this problem........ - I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString. The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG (more specifically LC_ALL). When they are set to japanese, the text gets truncated. When they are set to english, everything works fine. I am taking the default for XmNcolumns. (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application, just in my sample code to make things easier) - I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01. My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters. I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts. - Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL. The problem does NOT happen with XmText. Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it. My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the source to look at it is just a guess. Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion, or if you want the sample program. THANKS!!!!!!!! - Susan	5

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens when bold is displayed. It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold. I wish someone would prove that incorrect.	5

I'm trying to make a 24 bit window using XCreateWindow on a 8 bit PseudoColor server. As far as I know this should be possible if you server supports a TrueColor or DirectColor visual.

Hi, I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1). Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and not when the resources are loaded on demand. Is there a proper solution to this? So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color. But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH). Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color. However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color, things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do about it? I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for? Thanks in advance for replying, Marcel.	5

Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color, say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000. My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the "original" part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else is a grey..the oval "tries" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created. For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area. What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window? Second question: Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???	5
Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library. For Network discussion... Color Coordination... I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no one responded at all. The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working. ``Color needful applications'' such as : Picture and graphic displayers, Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... . The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use. Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''. * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors EG: values 0, 128 and 255. This results in 3 ^ 3 colors (27) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons. * two extra shades of grey EG: vales (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager. This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the workstation.

We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs. I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. So far I've drawn the following conclusions: 1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs 2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit 3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one) 4) tcl/tk is a little buggy 5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info) 6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product. 7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money) 8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work 9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ? 10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development. I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products. thanks	5
Using the usersub stuff in perl, you can incorporate things like curses for use in perl. I was wondering if anyone had done this with X (preferably Motif), and if so, where I could get the source for it?	5
Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from 'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by X. Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there for the 'original' format. Email replies preferred. Thanks in advance.	5
this is a repost... I like to find out more about this also... *** Message Part 2: Text **************************************** The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common GUI. But what does this mean exactly? - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will have the Motif look and feel? - Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif toolkit API? - Do they mean both of the above? - Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with an OpenLook Look & Feel? - How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F? (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?) - Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported? - How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif? This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much knowledge about these questions off the net...

Hi, Could some please tell me the errors of my ways. I am trying to update a drawable. This drawable happens to be a Pixmap on a button.

I then do sprintf(tmp_str,"R=%d",++fun); XDrawString(XtDisplay(m_usr[0]), bmaps[0] ,my_gc, 78, 10, tmp_str, (strlen(tmp_str)) ); The problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is still there. Even if I pass XClearArea a False and see it clear when it redraws the new info, the old info is still there. Help Please!!!

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is: o undo has been implemented. By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited, levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things, o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems: Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems. Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites. Check your nearest using xarchie. If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the word "help" alone in your message body. You will receive instructions on how to ftp via email.

I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change - Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 3.0, and I'm probably going to have to take v2 off line (I somehow missed the "shareware" designation in the README of v2, and didn't realize that we were supposed to register). I also debate whether this, with the new "institutions must pay" policy belongs in the contrib directory on export - to me, "contrib" means "contributed" (i.e. no strings, except copyright) attached.	5
Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists --------------------------------------------- Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list. Similarly, there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general. With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.* hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide. biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within "biz". Given the content, this change relocated the "opendesktop" newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new "announce" and "general" groups. On Aug 1, 1991, the former "sco-list@uunet.uu.net" became "scogen" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions. biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code. The binaries and sources news groups are moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups. Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts. biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine. Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed, you are now able to subscribe to the following: Newsgroup mailing list subscription --------- ------------------------- biz.sco.opendesktop scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources <none> biz.sco.binaries <none> biz.sco.magazine scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail. Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I'll do my best to help. We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites. If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists. The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email. Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate "mailing list subscription" address above, including in the message body: Add: subscriber_address -eg- Add: your_logname@site.do.main -or- Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial. Deletions are handled the same way, simply substitute "Delete:" for "Add:", ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with. Mailing list subscribers receive "how to post to the mlist" article submission information when their request is processed. If you don't receive an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host. In such cases, it's likely that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again. Mailing list subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site(s) feeding you. Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site. We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month. If this happens to you, please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site. What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable): biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past, present, and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it's various bundled components. biz.sco.general: Questions, answers and comments on SCO products in general, and of course resulting discussions. biz.sco.announce: SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products, and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors. (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general). biz.sco.sources: SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities, modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix, UNIX, and/or OpenDesktop. biz.sco.binaries: Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO "custom" utility. biz.sco.magazine: Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers, writers and publishers. You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup. For example, posting your ODT question to the "general" newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives. Appropriate crossposting is allowed. The undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco namespace. Suggestions for additional biz.sco.* newsgroups and/or mailing lists should be emailed to the address below.	5
I'm quite familiar with a variety of window title *setting* methods. My question is... Is there any way (via Resources, etc) to stop an application's ability to re-name it's own Name / IconName properties? ...who cares if it's not 'nice' to the application - I WANT CONTROL! ;-) -Mike	5

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes, most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar file). Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/... so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them. I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way. Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun (SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even tried hard copying all the relevant files into the "right" places and every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.	5
Will someone who can 'see' the X-Face included in this header please reply and tell me if it turned out okay? I'm not all too sure about my viewing software. I *hand*-converted this thing in "vi" from a Sun rasterfile... what a pain! For folks who haven't the slightest, it went like this: ------------------------------------------------------------- How to Make Your Own X-Face: in 0x000F Easy Steps! 1. Scan my Drivers' License into a *.PCX file. 2. Use WinGIF to 'trim' my face out of the license, 'reduce' it by half, and convert it to *.BMP. 3. Use Paintbrush to touch up manually. 4. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again. 5. Use Paintbrush to touch up again. 6. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half *again* and convert it to *.GIF. [now over to the UNIX side...] 7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile. 8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and convert it to an X bitmap. 9. Use "vi" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert the rasterfile into the "Uncompressed X-Face" format. (Lots of global "ed" commands, and by the time you're done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!) [now over to the *Linux* side...] A. Use "compface" to convert it to what you see here: %:A<m@Dob}BO"'E",EEQGbn7qy(En7aS5U([k//"G{6^HIbY9X8~+PD($}6szF"&vVxCXSn 8mw^0G#nVHE%W,`X"[j0s{r.~%zs:O|HFU=LwzYgH B.

Has anybody built an X11R5 server that can run on a Personal Decstation 5000 line with ultrix 4.3? The only catch is that being "personal" machines, we did not install DECnet onto them, which the Xdec server on gatekeeper requires.	5

We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1. It appears that pointer to the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the "w" of (w, client, call) ) is nil. The client and call pointers are okay in some instances, but bogus in other instances. We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4. After compiling X11R5 and all 23 patches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we recompiled the application. Did we skip a step or leave something out? Is there a flag that we should have used? Should we have left Motif alone? Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Kathy	5
The *fastest* way is to use an X server with shared memory extension. It uses shared memory if it is a local X server (hence images don't have to be duplicated), and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension is not available, or if it's not the localhost.	5

Xt(App)AddTimeout doesn't work in xterm, because, despite appearances to the contrary, xterm is not really an Xt based application. "Other sources" like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm's main loop. So don't be surprised when you try this and it doesn't work. --	5

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15",200mbDISK is going to cost /WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000. Color makes it not apples/apples too. Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs. You can make a PC much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and cost more. You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability of a PC. For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.	5
Hello, Below I have the copy of some source I am using to setup a user-specified color- map for X R11 V4. I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of RGB color ranges. The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective. Variables are defined are as follows: int i, j, k, lut_index color_type min_image, max_image; color_type image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump, lut [ 512 ]; unsigned long pixel; double red, green, blue; /* * Data structure used by color operations * typedef struct { unsigned long pixel; unsigned short red, green, blue; char flags; /-* do_red, do_green, do_blue *-/ char pad; } XColor; ***************/ XColor rgbcolor, hardwarecolor; With color_type defined as { double red, double green, double blue }. What I need to know is how to set [is it possible] the values in hardwarecolor to work within the call to XAllocColor: start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red; /* 0..255 */ end.red = (int) 255 * max_image.red; /* 0..255 */ jump.red = (int) (( end.red - start.red ) / 7); start.green = (int) 255 * min_image.green; /* 0..255 */ end.green = (int) 255 * max_image.green; /* 0..255 */ jump.green = (int) (( end.green - start.green ) / 7); start.blue = (int) 255 * min_image.blue; /* 0..255 */ end.blue = (int) 255 * max_image.blue; /* 0..255 */ jump.blue = (int) (( end.blue - start.blue ) / 7); lut_index = 0; for (i=0; i<8; i++) for (j=0; j<8; j++) for (k=0; k<8; k++) { if ( i == 0 || jump.red < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].red = start.red; else lut [ lut_index ].red = jump.red * i - 1; if ( j == 0 || jump.green < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].green = start.green; else lut [ lut_index ].green = jump.green * j - 1; if ( k == 0 || jump.blue < 1 ) lut [ lut_index ].blue = start.blue; else lut [ lut_index ].blue = jump.blue* k - 1; hardwarecolor.red = (short) lut [ lut_index ].red; hardwarecolor.green = (short) lut [ lut_index ].green; hardwarecolor.blue = (short) lut [ lut_index ].blue; hardwarecolor.pixel = lut_index; printf("HW1: i = %d : %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red, hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); status = XAllocColor ( dpy, colormap, &hardwarecolor ); printf("HW2: i = %d: %d %d %d: pixel = %d \n", lut_index, hardwarecolor.red, hardwarecolor.green, hardwarecolor.blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); if ( status != 0 ) { XSetForeground ( dpy, gc, hardwarecolor.pixel ); XFillRectangle ( dpy, win, gc, 1, 1, MAXCOLUMN, MAXROW ); XFlush ( dpy ); sleep (10); printf("%d: %f %f %f at %d \n", lut_index, lut [ lut_index ].re lut [ lut_index ].green, lut [ lut_index ].blue, hardwarecolor.pixel ); } lut_index = lut_index + 1; } Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with this problem.

I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000 based graphic card with 1 Meg of memory. I know this card is supported in Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is 17" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true? I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and so was thinking of buying a cheap 14" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14" SVGA monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz. Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? Please reply by email. Thaks in advance.	5

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed API to some multi-bytes fonts ? (such as Chinese, Japanese...) Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there anybody has done some similar jobs ? By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button.... That will be great if someone can share us what you have done. Thanks in advance.	5
Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu). The reference is to the R5 documentation. I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what is going on. The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and MenuPopup actions.

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input. I'd like to be able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running (just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything I type be entered as ALL CAPS. When the cursor is in any of my many other windows, I want to automatically return to normal functionality. I have point-to-type set. Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)? Is there a way to mess with .Xdefaults to make a category of window do this? Any hints would be most appreciated. I program in C but not X, although I can pick up somthing that's not too involved. Thanks kindly.	5

So what? I'm running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box. I cannot make out ANY difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or not (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of time for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this application is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when designing the xterm software. Michael	5

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop! What if you are on an Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine? That is when the load problems occur. If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable ethernet bandwidth waste. I'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life out there besides distributed or singleuser "Workstations"!	5
Any Tcpview-for-Sun users out there? I pulled down the pre-compiled executables made for Sun for Tcpview, but I'm getting a whole slew of the following types of error messages when I try to start it up: Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfActivate:ManagerParentActivate()' Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfCancel Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfCancel:ManagerParentCancel()' Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfSelect Warning: ... found while parsing '<Key>osfSelect:ManagerGadgetSelect()' ...

Any tips? I'm mystified.	5
Hi, I've tried to get rid off XDM's ugly Login window by giving it a 'cool' backgroundPixmap ressource. As Login is derived from Core, this should be possible. Anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too. Any way to do it ?	5
Yes we have the same problem with xinit. The problems seems to come from the fact that the XOpenDisplay(":0") fails.

Xm++/CommonInteract Another User Interface Development System ------------------- If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style like this... // mini sample application ///////////////////////////////////// class Test : public XmWindow { void cmd(char*); void quit(void*); public: Test() : XmWindow("Xm++ Test Window") {} void initialize(); }; void Test::initialize() { XmDropdownMenu* menu = createDropdownMenu(); menu->addLabel("&File"); menu->addItems( Entry("Menu Item &One", CB(Test::cmd)), Entry("Menu Item &Two", CB(Test::cmd)), NULLENTRY); menu->addSeparator(); menu->addItem( Entry("E&xit", CB(Test::quit))); addSubpane(Edit, "myEdit"); edit("myEdit")->setText("Hello World."); } void Test::cmd(char* n) { edit("myEdit")->setText(n); } void Test::quit(void*) { exit(0); } void XmApp::initialize() { (new Test)->initialize(); } /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README): Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11 and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets. Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes, although many nice features are only available when using Motif. In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases. Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version, which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications (in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-). Top level objects in Xm++: * 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution) Controls (children of top level objects): 'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton', 'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text. Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects. CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system (research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices). If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of the art' from 1991). CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also. Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed. About this first release: Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes. CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications. Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on: HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

Check out a program called PC-Xview. I've used it before, and from what I can tell, it's exactly what you're looking for. Last I checked, you should be able to find it for about $160 a copy. -Eric	5
Hi, Does anyone know how to redirect the stdout and stderr of a program to a callback function in X ? The program does not fork() a child process so I guess I can't use pipes. Can anyone help ? Thanks,	5
Hi folks, I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0, and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake. Specifically, make bombs when it needs to use any Xaw file. This isn't surprising since X11 files on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under /usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!) Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't know how to tell imake where the X11 files are. I can see from the Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the Makefile reads # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit! Help! Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to look? (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README file.) Email and post are both fine. Thanks in advance,	5
I have the task to program a X application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which I can draw something. Unfortunately some basic books on the topic of X application programming are not available to me for the moment. I am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, VUE and X11R4 using Xt anbd Xaw. What I did until now: I initialized the X Intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with XtAppInitialize. I passed as a application_class name 'commandWidgetClass'. Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues. When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it. Can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ? In which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ? Thanks very much in advance Soenke --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Soenke Voss Faculty of Economics soenke@wiwi12.uni-bielefeld.de University of Bielefeld Germany	5
Hi All, I've heard of a commercial package named ZINK, that could convert MS-Windows source-code to XWindows source-code (C). The only problem is, the package isn't available in Holland (at least, I can't find it anywhere :-( ) Is there another package (preferrably free- or shareware), that can do the same thing? And if so, where can I find or buy it? Thanks in advance	5

That's not all it says. The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8 of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons. The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One, chapter 9. You should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated.	5
You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd, which does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so - call your local office. The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard rumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.	5
The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string; it used the character count instead of the byte count... a significan "Oops". The problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic patch from HP support services.	5
< <>OW 3.0 is the same. But, the definition of broken is relative. Pageview <>requires DSC compliant PostScript files, in order to stop at page breaks. <>I don't consider that broken. I say that any program that puts out a <>PostScript file that isn't DSC compliant is broken. < <Well that may be true. However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0 <does not mention about DSC compliance. In any event, the point here <is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will <find out that it's not a practical tool. It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be DSC compliant. That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at Sun. I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview program does require DSC compliant PostScript. There was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it would stop at each showpage. I believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go forward to the next showpage. This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?). In any event, I find pageview extremely useful. Since all of the PostScript that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.	5

Greetings, We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1 and Openwindows 3. 7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into xterminals. We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays. When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness. With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually getting munged. Let me try to be precise: The user sitting at the machine that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having control of his keyboard and screen yanked away. (When this was the department chair, it was kind of cute). We poked at xdm for a few days and are satisfied that it is not at fault. Our current theory is that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm, and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal server). Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior? Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory? How about obvious gimmes? And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it? Any ideas are greatly appreciated.	5
Hello!!! The title just about says it all. I need a list of the bugs for Motif 1.2.	5
i want to do something like this: date | xcb -s 0 | xcutsel to get the output of the date command put into the XPRIMARY selection. unfortunately, xcutsel is an interactive little bugger and there isn't a command argument to tell it to just do it and not put up its little window. so, is there some other command that i CAN use like this? or, is there an analog to xcb that will put stuff in XPRIMARY instead of cut buffer 0?	5
Hi, I'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering to an X display and then playing it back again. Rather than "reinvent the wheel", it like to find: * a file format for saving X protocol. * software that saves and replays such a session. Any ideas out there? I've heard that there is a version of Xscope that will save and replay sessions. I'd be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community. Axel............	5
:Read the xterm's manual pages for more informations about the avaliable :actions of xterm. Read the FAQ and get a good book on customizing your :X applications. Okay, I will byte. Could someone provide more info on a 'good book on customizing your X applicaitons'?

Does any one out there have experience with Planet X, I am considering buying it to use on a SPARCstation IPC, in this way I can run Mac programs from the SPARC. Would you recommend buying this piece of Software and what is the emulation on the SPARC like? Does it give a window of a Mac or does it give a window of just the individual programs? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Dean	5
I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1). The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike in the major version number, is: o undo has been implemented. By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited, levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is supported. There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about: aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features, amongst other things, o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and Xaw3d options, on the following systems: Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first. A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one. Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems. Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release, 2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it. aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due course from several other ftp sites. Check your nearest using xarchie. If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the word "help" alone in your message body. You will receive instructions on how to ftp via email.

Yesterday I changed the US-Keyboard of my Sparc10 with a german keyboard. And now I cannot get any "Alt Graph" characters ('tilde' usw.). When I exit from X I can get the characters, but not under X. Can anybody give me some hints, where to check for the correct installation of the keyboard.	5
Yes, it is. It is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably in pub/xkernel. In response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4. The binaries available are for the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most architectures, and he does have a 'do-it-yourself' type distribution. We use Xkernel for about 7 machines here. email me if you have any questions I can help you with...	5
I am looking of information regarding UIMX. I believe this is an application front end generator tool for Motif (among others). Whould someone given me a contact? I need to get hold of the programmers' guide, or something like it.	5
Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0, the animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to comp.windows.x.announce. This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to remove leading and trailing text at the "---cut here---" markers (including the markers themselves). Next type "cat file1 file2 > file", then "uudecode file" and "zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -". Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there. Enjoy! Derek P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include files. ----------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------	5
Hi all, I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is quite simple; some aggregated code: XFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height); XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...); XCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0); I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2. The question is: is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do something wrong within my code?? Sorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of error it is.

Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface. If your question isn't here, please try (at *least*) man openwin man xnews man 7 xview and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists. Special Notes: * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4, due to ship later this year. * Yes, Sun is moving to Motif, along with all of COSE. But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif, with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features added. * Yes, OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS. NeWS is dead. This means TNT is dead, too. * XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the next release. I don't know if there will be a source release of XView 3.1 or not. * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet, ported to Motif. Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool, at least. * Yes, the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant. Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly. This is version: $Revision: 1.48 $; Last posted version: 1.46 Contents: (in rn and trn you can use control-G to go to the next topic) Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK, OpenWindows, X11, XView, (MO)OLIT, Motif Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste Subject: Applications: Finding Out...

Subject: Bibliography -- books, manuals, journals, papers, beer-mats Subject: Getting this File, Revision History, Recent Changes Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK, OpenWindows, X11, XView, OLIT, MOOLIT, Motif @ What is OPEN LOOK? OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you edit files, etc. The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?). See Also: Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications. It's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView, so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems. It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors. OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively. It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else. A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server, plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk. The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are: SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0 Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0 Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1 See Also: Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it? @ What are OLIT, XView and TNT? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications. See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits. Here's a brief summary: OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system; it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn. You could buy the source from AT&T, although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship. Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in System V Release 4. It was written in C. The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0. OLIT support passed to USL (then a division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.). Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses. [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference] XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C. XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView. There's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView. XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows. The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere). The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0. Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun. XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS. On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT. The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS. TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application. It's currently included in OpenWindows. The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript. Wail. You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing. Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however. The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files. The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color. It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2. UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun. It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!). @ Where does Motif fit in? It doesn't :-). Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF. It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager. There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF. Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a large installed base. Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable. @ What is MoOLIT? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time. It will be part of System V Release 4.2. Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows. DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use, as I understand it. The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine. Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen. Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs. It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard. (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available, however) Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm? They are window managers. A window manager is the part of the X Window system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows. Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager. It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it. Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the `v' in its name). It shows a little map on the screen, with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle. You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys. This lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around from one to the other. Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it. Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib directory; there are three patches). @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm? Yes. If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages. If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run under olwm. For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc: LeftTitleButton "target" = f.delete where "target" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps. Alternatively, try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton ":menu" = f.menu "OL.menu" menu "OL.menu" { "Quit" f.delete } For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told). See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc). Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11. This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems. Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal. This includes pageview in particular. You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones) will work perfectly well. You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found. If so, see the Fonts section below. If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help. Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ($HOME). If it already exists, you might have to edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files. If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc, since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file. .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory, depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change. You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized. If you are not on an X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C, shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's "contool" program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen. Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc. .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here. In particular, it is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience: true *Input: TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults. Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them. .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews) on startup. This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the back. The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways. The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient. WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3. Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see the man page for xset ("man xset", and "xset -help") for more information. Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for OpenWindows 3. You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-) Again, this is for OpenWindows 3... % don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual % /IncludeDemos? false def UserProfile begin /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly... end You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this: /NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop % force repeat.ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this: $ psh -i .startup.ps Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 /classinit ClassRepeatKeys send %%% now press control-D You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make the root window be "retained", so that a PostScript drawing on the background won't be erased when you move windows: frambuffer /Retained true put will do this. Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically. See also: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting: Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults? Environment Variables @ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard? You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises. See also "man 7 xview" for a list of keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs. With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle them. The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this in your .xinitrc: if eval `svenv -env` then xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3" input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1" fi @ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle? Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but effective screen saver. See `man screenblank'. Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as it's not supplied. Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically. Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste @ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs? To go from XTerm to textedit (say): * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong) * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v) If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm: * Select the text in textedit. No need to use COPY * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button). * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons. @ COPY/PASTE is boring. What short-cuts are available? Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc: * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button * Select the text you want to copy/move. You'll see that it's underlined or crossed out, as appropriate. (In the jed demo it goes grey) * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button. * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret. Drag and Drop to Move a Selection * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple- clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon). * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show that it's OK to drop things here * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved. This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows. Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button. @ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere? See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them. In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the right of the insert point. Meta-i - include file Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward) Ctrl-a - start of line Ctrl-< - back word Ctrl-e - end of line Ctrl-> - forward word Ctrl-w - delete word Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page. @ What can I put in my .ttysrc? Where is it documented? See the manual page for shelltool. Subject: Applications: Finding Out... Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide, which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_ Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly. Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK applications. Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full product documentation. SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license. There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a faster reply. Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc. @ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)? Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages. If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below. @ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail? The best way is: $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer) add the follwing: KEY_RIGHT(3) FILTER cat ~/.signature (you might need to change ~ to $HOME) Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file. Subject: Fonts @ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts? Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which). Or, Not Yet, in other words. If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told. The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is interesting... The F3 font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below. Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts. You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably other major foundries. SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts. @ Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as fast as loading a bitmap :-). You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters. If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size. $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you currentfontmem = % type this line ... 300 % and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 1024 setfontmem % Just to check: currentfontmem = 1024 See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide. You need to say psh -i so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page. @ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup: $ mkdir $HOME/myfonts $ cd $HOME/myfonts $ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b Creating Bembo20.afb $ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied. $ ls Bembo20.afb Bembo20.fb Synonyms.list $ bldfamily * Bembo ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin) cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory $ xset +fp `pwd` $ xset fp rehash If you want the server to see your new font directory every time, add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile. @ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.) You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a bitmap (X11 bdf format) first. Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for printing. Having said all that... you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf. Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows. You can also use der Mouse's "getbdf" to get bdf fonts from a running X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf @ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi There aren't any. More precisely, the various text fonts, such as Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are scalable under OpenWindows. The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't scale very well. Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages @ No manual entry for cm_lookup If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable: MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man for csh users. $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems. @ window: Window creation failed to get new fd @ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Cannot create base frame. Process aborted. These messages all come from SunView programs. SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked. Some of the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts. You almost certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead. Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc. @ memory fault - core dumped If you get this from the binder, or if binder vanishes suddenly, get the following patches: 100493-02 Binder 100524-03 Cetables 100626-03 Tooltalk @ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local Sun office and request the following patches: 100512-02 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add -u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line. An alternative is to add -assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl. Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type @ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least: OpenWindows.FocusLenience: true *Input: TRUE in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it. See the next item for editing .Xdefaults Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working @ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead: XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \ <Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\ <Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing L8 (the Paste key)! Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm. [See also: Environment Variables] This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard: XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta<BtnUp>: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD)\n\ <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) [Note: be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line, there must be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file was altered must also be removed!] If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines <Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\ <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key! If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a `more specific' resource name: xterm.vt100.translations will do. @ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively. You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the defaults): Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6 OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste", "v+Meta,L8 Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages. @ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v) Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the next item. @ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only) Oh dear. Use ps -xuaww | grep xv to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started OpenWindows with "openwin" or by logging in through xdm. If not, start it. If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can reboot your workstation. Check that there is space in /tmp (use "df /tmp"), and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out. Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files that are still there. It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working again you can just carry on. Note that files in /tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without checking first! Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display If you get error messages that look like Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server Xlib: Internal error during connection authorization check Error: Can't Open display try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11, xhost +machine where "machine" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed. If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you, using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost +`hostname` (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation). This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display. With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101. This is more secure. Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly! Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem. It is available through your local Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist: Fix PatchID Filename Checksum loadmodule 1076118 100448-01.tar.Z 04354 5 On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display. If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight, there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have a hostname before the :, or is empty. Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets. Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems @ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4) If "refresh" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later, you need to run "xterm -C" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in the background and then choose Save Workspace from the Workspace->Utilities menu. Better still, pick up "contool" and run that. Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory. It will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a message appears; it's very easy to configure. If "refresh" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages, go away... a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto a whole new (but monochrome) display, called ":0.1". See the man. page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and, if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file: ( eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env` olvwm -display unix:0.1 ) & Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically. You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages. Also, see the note about contool, above. @ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults? Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'. This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your .Xdefaults after removing comments. It then applies any changes. Keep comments by using "comment." instead of "!", for example, comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37 @ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit? set the default editor to sh -c "exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \"$FILE\"" (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one) @ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video? This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2. With OpwnWindows 3.0, there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options. If you're using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool. @ Why don't flat check-boxes work? A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these. A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output that's broken, not the actual check-box code. This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0. If you're still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible; the new one is fantastic! @ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen. Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin'). @ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something. This was a bug related to some systems only. The only work-round was to use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc. @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working? Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 respectively in OpenWindows 3. Applications must be recompiled, or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again. @ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version See under "Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages" below. (see also next item) @ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows (see also next item) Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch level 18), but not the contrib directory. These notes apply to OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5. Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11. You can intermix OpenWindows and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect. Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11. Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a matter of preference. In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that. If you have /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones! Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11 library directory. This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't do this. The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although xdm core dumps if this isn't right. Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't /usr/openwin. See Also: Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH). @ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin. If you also use X11, use /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for /bin/sh; for csh it is different. @ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero Your system needs to be patched. Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches and install the patch. @ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me? You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook. It won't run under X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw the PostScript text and pictures. If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0 compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM. If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia!) The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2. Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with a PostSript viewer (q.v.). @ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb? A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z @ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu? It isn't implemented yet. Many programs do respond to the Properties Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it. @ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine. It also works if you run command tool on a remote machine. Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2. @ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red! Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard. The currently selected item is highlighted in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus. To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file: *traversalOn: off *TextEdit.traversalOn: on *TextField.traversalOn: on You can change the color using (for example) *InputFocusColor: grey50 *input*FocusColor: green *List*inputFocusColor: <your background color> See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation. Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch. @ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when I move into a different window! ("colormap flashing") This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time. However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure: * Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve. * Run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file * Put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc) * Exit and then restart the window system. * cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them. Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page. @ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above): This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows. Try running pageview like this: $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono $OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview $OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard @ XDM breaks things Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'. Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well. SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables. Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass root... @ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names ("keysyms") for these keys was changed to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37. Code which uses them should be recompiled, or you might be able to get away with xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36' Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been promised, but hasn't reached here. Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month. You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x. @ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items? PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle. PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles. There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font. You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits. @ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed? In the button callback, do xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL); This will keep the window visible. You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute. @ how do I make an XView button look pressed? call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source... @ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).

XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere. MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form. OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from Interactive Systems Inc. It is also included in some vendors' System V Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version. The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0. Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as the windowing system for Solaris. There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress. Unfortunately, none of them seem to be available from anywhere.

That's expected. The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the MenuButton section of the "Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface" documentation states bitmap A bitmap to display instead of the label. One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap resource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able to set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the button's dimensions to match its size. Jim	5
Hello, Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows in a number of applications. We are trying to use action translation tables to implement this. We have only succeeded by assigning the translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single application. The Xt calls we make are included below. It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations, and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications. If someone could describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

Excerpts from netnews.comp.windows.x: 15-May-93 Re: COLORS and X windows (A.. John Cwikla@morrison.wri (4620) What I'd like to see is this scenario: Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. They are not directly tied to the object that uses them. Palettes are held in the server. A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of hardware color cells of color descriptors. When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette. ALL OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel) into its associated palette.	5
Ok, I'm being driven batty. Trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu appears). I would really like to use the standard Athena classes to achieve this goal, but for my best attempts I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton as the parent of the widget tree. I know this should be possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded() and a little twiddling, but something is escaping me.	5
I've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of a piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget. I've managed to make it work in some ugly ways, but either a) X blocks on the tail and won't allow user input, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn't follow the expansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn't die after I've closed the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting for tail to die. I _know_ this code has to exist. Anybody have it? A general popen() case would be perfered but at this point I'll take anything... Thanks.	5

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...) DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display on the net). Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform; many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!) If you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com, and I'd be happy to fill you in.	5
Is there such a document either in the Bookstores or possible on an ftp site somewhere? Nothing really fancy, just something that gives a listing of the available widgets, and the resources that are pertinant to them, and what flavors of Motif they occur in.	5

Help, I've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across the top (a toolbar). I wanted to add eventhandlers to these pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it. I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem: When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of the above events, but when they are not sensitive I only get callbacks on LeaveWindow events. This seems odd. I would expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing. Is this a bug? If not, can someone explain this behavior? thanks,	5
I have done this before, but I'm not sure I used the best approach (although I tried several methods...). You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get to the root window. Now, this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window, so be sure to take that into account for further calculations. Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry(). BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION. Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly. All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using. Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly). DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code. But I did get it working under several window managers correctly. Feel free to call or e-mail for further info. -McGary	5
I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems getting started. I think that some files are missing on the system, but there is the possibility that they are just in a different directory. When I try to link my program it can't find XtInitailize, XtRealizeWidget, XtMainLoop, XtCreateManagedWidget, or commandWidgetClass. I've included Intrinsic.h and Command.h. I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with a NULL in order to compile and see if there were any other problems. I haven't used a toolkit before and this is simply an example I got from the manuel. Can someone tell me where I might look for these calls, that is, in what file not what directory they are supposed to be under because the system manager doesn't believe in standard directories and generally does things his own way. (I am using UNIX) Thank you for your assistance.	5
I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say, I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network. Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live without it. Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself. As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area. Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often. Thanks for any replies. Brian "Rev. P-K" Siano revpk@cellar.org	2

I'd like to appeal to the net's NT wizards for a bit of advice. First a general description of the machine as follows: Motherboard: Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset, 20 meg memory, 256kb cache (soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it) Fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg, 1024x768x256) ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller tertiary disk = Fujitsu ??? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface. Other hardware includes modem/fax, serial ports, and a teletext board (ugly dos software drives the latter) Applications used include normal windows stuff (excel, word, Quicken and Turbo Pascal/Windows) but the important stuff is my Audio work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows, MCS Stereo, and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files. Also I use Stacker on the primary drive, HP Newwave (for my wife's use, and she won't let me get rid of it!), and a product called Infinite Disk from Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline files. I plan to upgrade to NT, when it becomes a released product. I was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on, but I don't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta software. I expect to buy it, tear off the shrink wrap, and use it without hassle (I know, unrealistic, but I can hope can't I, after all, I have work to do). The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers, and hardware specific stuff in general. How smoothly can I expect the upgrade to go? Can I expect support for all my stuff, or do I still need to scramble around downloading drivers (PAS?, Orchid?, Colorado?) from some bbs, etc. What steps should I take to ensure the installation goes smoothly. Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system. I'm allergic to command lines! I plan to run a "pure" NT system. Also, will NT communicate with the workgroups lan? What about stacker? I currently have stacker on the first disk drive. Without Stacker, and the Infinite Disk product, I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the system (It's cramped now). I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT, but will there be an NT version? Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6? I know Infinite Disk will be incompatible with NT, but will they offer (or does anybody else) a comparable product for NT and at what cost? (perhaps I need to ask Chili Pepper that question) I can live without ID if I have to, but I'd rather not. Will NT run my DOS apps (the teletext board mainly) without DOS on the system? What do I need to keep around? Any feedback or advice (including "forget NT" with good reasons) is much appreciated. My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better multitasking environment than Windows (among other reasons, WAVE locks up the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files), and I want better lan support than I now have (Internet access, etc). Maybe there are better solutions than NT and if so, I would appreciate hearing about them (OS/2? What's it's status these days?)

I _do_ know that IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in particular, have absolutely no problem with OS/2--never had a "random" crash while running any of my programs under OS/2. In fact, I don't remember _ever_ crashing. Of course, I really don't run any OS/2 programs, just the same bunch of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running. And when I had the 56SLC (this is the 386SLC system) running Dos/Windows, I had only one crash, and it was consistent. FTP had a tendency to crash whenever I would get large files (>1mb) from particularly fast clients (DTR's 150K-200K/sec), I figured out the problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write buffer, everything would work fine. FTP under OS/2 has never locked, though. I can even format floppies (to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.) Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2 is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware. WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2... Well, I save all my personal files to floppy, and when i did that under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system. I also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the background.	2
I've recently uploaded to cica the current (v2.8) version of the working model of MicroCal Origin, a scientific and technical 2D/3D graphics and data analysis package for Windows 3.x. The working model is 2D only and puts a promo message on hardcopies, but is largely identical to the full version. Saving Origin files is disabled, but you can save ASCII data sets produced with Origin. It also says it has an expiration date of Sept. 1, 1993. Try it. You may like it, as I do! It's currently in /pub/pc/win3/uploads as ORIGIN.ZIP.	2
Hello, recently I noticed there is a directory named "DiskImage" in my disk. I didn't notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of the disk was created, or if Win3.1 automatically created a backup of its files. I couldn't find any documentation on the diskimage utility; having an image of the disk is taking *a lot* of disk space. Does anybody know if this is just something the people who installed Win3.1 did or it is a backup mechanism?

I have been posting monthly "how-to-setup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a few months. Lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for March or earlier this month -- for which I apologize. This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota PHONE, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with PHONE. For additions, modifications and corrections, I can be reached at <ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu> Best wishes, Ashok -- begin SLIP.TXT -- Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows, here are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment. I thank the Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring your Modem: a) Turn off DTR (AT&D0&W) I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use to dial my SLIP server (QMODEM) drops DTR when I exit the program and therefore hangs up the line. If you use a program like Kermit or Conex to establish the SLIP connection, then this need not be done. These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit. NOTE: If you use Univ. of Minn. PHONE to dial and establish a SLIP connection, you do not need to turn off DTR. b) Dial and establish the SLIP connection first. This can be done automatically if you use a program like PHONE (from the University of Minnesota) which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the SLIP packet driver. The PHONE scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with other SLIP server. In addition, while the only packet driver that PHONE works with is UMSLIP (currently), it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers. There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and batch file examples. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring the SLIP drivers: There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available CSLIPPER.EXE Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver SLIPPER.EXE Peter Tattam's SLIP driver SLIP8250.COM Crynwr driver (I like Phil Burn's modified driver) ETHERSL.COM Crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over SLIP) UMSLIP.COM Univ. of Minnesota driver (based on SLIP8250) Of these four, I vastly prefer C/SLIPPER.EXE over SLIP8250.COM or ETHERSL.COM for the following reasons: a) It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART b) While using EtherSLIP/SLIP8250/UMSLIP, myself and several others have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a long FTP transfer. c) It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode d) When used in Ethernet simulation mode C/SLIPPER seem to work with every TCP/IP application that I have tested it with. Instructions for C/SLIPPER.EXE (and you do not use PHONE) a) Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file according to instructions: For instance if you have a v.32bis modem on COM1 slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600 b) If you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Win 3.1 DOS boxes, then use the double-ended packet driver shim WinPKT.COM -- this creates a virtual packet driver at 0x60. DOS applications in native mode, DOS applications in Windows 3.1 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all use this virtual driver at 0x60. winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 c) If you use QVT/Net, load PKTINT.COM next. QVT/net is configured in QVTNET.INI to use the interrupt at 0x60. pktint.com Instructions for SLIP8250.COM: a) Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver. Philip Burns of Northwestern University has a modified SLIP8250.COM driver that is better at hardware handshaking. This driver is distributed along with NuPOP. b) Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection. My modem is a V.32bis modem on COM1, so here is how I would load the driver. slip8250 -w 0x62 -h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600 c) As discussed above if you use DOS TCP/IP applications in Windows 3.x DOS boxes, you probably want to use WINPKT.COM winpkt.com 0x60 0x62 d) If you use WinQVT/net, load PKTINT.COM pktint.com Instructions for ETHERSL.COM: If you choose to use ETHERSL.COM instead of SLIP8250.COM, the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. You will have to DELETE the line "device=*vcd" from the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm applications (such as Crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped characters etc. in these applications. This is therefore not recommended. ETHERSLIP would be loaded as: ethersl -w 0x62 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Configuring Windows 3.1: a) Make the following modifications to the SYSTEM.INI file [386Enh] section. i) List all your COM ports, with their addresses and interrupts. COM1Base=03F8 COM1Irq=4 COM2Base=02F8 COM2Irq=3 COM3Base=03E8 COM3Irq=5 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel, but double-clicking on the "Ports" icon. ii) Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer COM1Buffer=10000 iii) Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish to use for your modem to ZERO. This is the amount of time that Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to another application. If you use WinQVT/net and then want to switch from one session to another, and this value is at the default value of 2 seconds, you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash. COM1AutoAssign=0 This can also be done from within Windows - Control Panel. Double-click on 386 Enhanced, and under "Device Contention", set the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to "Never Warn" ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional notes: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each SLIP session? I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user a permanent IP address, so I do not have worry about editing QVTNET.INI each time that I establish a SLIP connection. If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in, please try to use BOOTP aware software, and let BOOTP do the configuration for you. However, QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP will not work over a SLIP connection. To get QVTNet working in a situation such as this, you must do the following: Edit the QVTNET.INI file. Let the [net] section look like this: [net] name= ip= netmask=255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you) arptime=20 packet_vector=60 (or whatever is appropriate) Save the changes, and then *write-protect* this file "attrib +r qvtnet.ini" Start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and IP address that you are assigned. Each time you start QVT/net 3.1x, the general configuration dialog box will open. Enter the name and IP address and you were assigned for that session, click on [OK], and you should be up and running. The changes you make will not be saved, as QVTNET.INI is write-protected. A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address assignment is provided by Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) Victor uses the program bootpq to semi-automate qvtnet preparation. Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP, which is then saved to a file called "myip". Another file "noip" is essentially a complete QVTNET.INI file that lacks the IP address. In the final step "myip" and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNET.INI file. An example of Victor's batch file is provided below: ===================================================== slipper com2 pktint.com bootpq -i "ip=\"%%s\"" >> myip bootpq -i "My IP# is: %s" copy /q net + myip + noip e:\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini del /q myip @echo off echo . echo Ready to run WinQVTnet ===================================================== For questions and more details about bootpq, please contact Victor Menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu) QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVT/net. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP? PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250.COM packet driver, and crashes immediately if used with ETHERSL.COM PKTMUX will work with C/SLIPPER.EXE, when C/SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode. An example of this configuration is shown below: The latest release of PKTMUX is 1.2c; and it is important that you use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like Trumpet for Windows (to be released very shortly). [from AUTOEXEC.BAT] lh c/slipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether (packet driver) lh pktmux 5 65 /5 (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used for QVT/net) lh pktint.com (QVT/net pktint.com) pktdrv 63 65 (PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet) Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within Windows 3.1 DOS boxes. For example, my PIF file to load POPmail is directed to the file "popmail.bat". This is what popmail.bat reads like: pktdrv 60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60 cd \popmail popmail cd \ pktdrv 60 /u unloads the packet driver at 0x60 exit causes the DOS window to close I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCP/IP applications like PC Gopher. It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt. For example within two different DOS boxes -- one for POPmail and the other for Gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each instance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of C/SLIPPER? I have a V.32bis/V.42bis modem in a 386-33 running Windows 3.1 with a reasonably fast video card (ATI Graphics Ultra). Under these conditions, when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows: a) Driver at 0x7f -- QVTNet FTP client session b) Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window -- CUTCP tn3270 session c) Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window -- Trumpet for DOS I get FTP transfer rates of 0.8 - 1.0 kb/sec while transferring compressed files. This rate is comparable to that which I get with SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver, and where a single TCP/IP session is active. If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session is active, I get transfer rates of 1.3 - 1.4 kb/sec on the same files. While there is about 40% degradation in the performance of SLIPPER, for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the performance hit. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- C/SLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode In ethernet simulation mode, C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 works with all the applications that I have tested it with. One or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at C/SLIPPER 1.2, but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3 When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with PKTMUX, I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads "IP:incorrect packet type" or "IP:bad version number". This does not seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning, although I cannot comment on loss of performance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- What can you do if your DOS TCP/IP application does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode? In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with C/SLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author -- Peter Tattam -- PETER@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him know. Chances are that he can fix it. In the meanwhile, you can try the following. I do not know if it is kosher, but it worked when I had problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.2 (C/SLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section) I load ETHERSL.COM at 0x60, run the application and then terminate ETHERSL.COM This also works within Windows 3.1 virtual DOS boxes. However a packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box at a time. So for example, here is my batch file to run Grateful Med (a medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library of Medicine). ethersl -w 0x60 -h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads ETHERSLIP cd \gm6 search cd \ termin 0x60 terminates ETHERSLIP exit closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows If you use this method, be cautious about one thing -- don't have any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time. After closing the ETHERSL window, you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no problem. BTW, the example above -- Grateful Med, works with no problems with C/SLIPPER ver 1.3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PHONE Script Files: The documentation that accompany PHONE, provide good instructions on writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than the University of Minnesota server. For example here is a script that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend. Background: To start a SLIP connection, I dial our terminal server, and login with a username and password. After doing so, I start a SLIP session with the following command "slip username-slip.dialin.cwru.edu", followed by my password -- again. Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONE.CMD script file - # # CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script by Ashok Aiyar 3/26/93 # Last revised 3/28/93 Procedure Host.CWRU.Login TimeOut 60 'CWRU-TS2 terminal server is not responding' Message "CWRU-TS2 SLIP login script -- Version 1.1" Message 'Waiting for SLIP server to respond' Quiet ON Expect 'Verification' Message 'Request for User Verification Received from CWRU-TS2' Message 'Sending your user name and password' Quiet OFF Expect 'Username:' Send '%u<' Expect 'Password:' Private Send '%p<' Reject 'Access denied' 'Your user name or password was not accepted' TimeOut 30 'SLIP server did not respond to your validation request' Expect 'CWRU-TS2>' Send 'SLIP<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to SLIP command' Expect 'IP hostname or address:' Send '%u-slip.dialin.cwru.edu<' TimeOut 10 'SLIP server did not respond to hostname' Reject 'Bad IP address' 'Incorrect Hostname' Expect 'Password:' Send '%p<' Reject 'Access denied' 'Password not accepted.'

The quick answer -- there is no "clean" way. Below is a batch file hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers. In this example, the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER. To use a batch file like this, you must know the parameters with which you plan to use the packet driver -- i.e interrupt vector, baud rate, port address, and IRQ. This batch file requires UMSLIP.COM, CSLIPPER.EXE, and TERMIN.COM to be in the same directory or in your path ... All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection using PHONE, load the appropriate packet driver, hangup the connection, and unload the driver when you are done ... -- being CWRUSLIP.BAT -- @echo off rem this batch file is an ugly hack of U. of Minn.

(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.) Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it. My envorinment ============== TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b- Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs After "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'. In the process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things. Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive ================================================== While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain applications appeared to run very much slower. What was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards. I suspected Double Space (DS) and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm). The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to DOS 6 with DS. Thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew that DS compression must cost something. Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings in I/O cycles). However, for all other cases, particularly large random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long. While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed. The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and slow disk I/O'. This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long. Double Space and Windows ======================== DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that matter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you get. How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder. Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed floppy! (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to.) DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM ============================================== Defragmentation seemed to take too much time. Even so, I waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm. This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used) but it took 12 minutes. I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly). It dawned on me that this had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle, and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process! After disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds. Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots ==================================================================== In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers ---------------------------------------------------------------- To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt. If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it means "disable all power saving features of your notebook". Why would anyone want to run a driver disabled! As I have found out, not only does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what else) are crippled by the TI's power saver. It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications. If there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI programmers dont know how to read these specifications. You dont have to guess as to who are the idiots. By the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE Power Management Status ----------------------- Setting = ADV: MAX CPU: idle 60% of time. This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in iconised form). Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work? Is such an overhead justified (whether or not Windows is an operating system or just another user interface)? (In DOS alone, it reports 99% idle time.) Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times! Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this: set PATH=C:\DOS ... set PATH=C:\ETC\BIN;%PATH%;C:\BIN ... set PATH=C:\ETC\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\WINDOWS ... set PATH=%PATH%;C:\BCC\BIN ... set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one (i.e. c:\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement, and prepends C:\DOS to its value. As a result, my resultant path has so many DOS's. If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path. (Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.) Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one) decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and prepend DOS to the value. I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process. I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft representative in Singapore called me about this poster. In fact he specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet. Now that has not changed one bit. In fact, if you have a PATH statement with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason? As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as: set MOUSE=C:\ETC\MOUSE set PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE% loadhigh %MOUSE%\MOUSE.COM Guess what MEMMAKER did? It replaced the last statement with LH ... C:\ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand. DOS 6 Software Quality ====================== DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage, you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it. I am deliberately being cryptic about this: I challenge Microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it. If they dont within a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file. Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of their products. I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality" when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but can only be built into the product. No wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair! Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the defragmenters. I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated when I did the chkdsk. This happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since. Microsft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we should watch out for if we have already used DS. Jaya	2

Has anyone observed this? If I copy a large, say 800K+ file (a large PKZIP file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell, the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not. The corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after both copies. The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption. Now here's the kicker: I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps. Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice, whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden). So, as an example, I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open, 2 multitasking DOS sessions running, and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized (inactive). Under this scenario, CPU time is divided into two major slices: one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app. When copying under Windows PGM MGR, I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive. Thus PGM MGR gets, say, 80% of the Windows slice and 95% of the execution-background DOS shell's slices. Thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = .72 or 72% of the total available CPU time. When copying in a DOS shell, I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell (no other DOS background tasks allowed), full screen, under the Windows task manager. The CPU time available to this shell would be 80% of the Windows slice (assumming inactive Windows applications) and 100% of the DOS slice: (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available CPU time. So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time? Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy? It must be!

(stuff deleted) This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago. My HD was stacked with Stacker v.2.0 (I run Dos5) Suddenly everything hung up, and most of the HD got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with 'funny' names). In other words: it is probably just the doubledisk part of Dos6 that is troublesome. I now use Stacker v 3.0, and so far I have had no trouble. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Elisabeth Bull e_mail: eliza@swix.nvg.unit.no	2

[ to a .rle file ^^^^^^^] I thought I'd reply to this, though I ain't brad. AT any case, a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to .bmp *will* convert to .rle. I Know for a fact that PaintShop (shareware from cica; /desktop, I think, filename psVVV.zip (I think, where VVV is the ver. number. If that's not true, let me know and I"ll post a corection). This, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you have to rename it. NOW, another thing.... this is from the windows' FAQ: your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that's what the faq says, but Mine wont work for more than about 30...maybe they mend 32K, I don't know). Your file has to fit VGA size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size is.) If you use a non-vga screen (e.g. Cga, ega, svga, there is also a way to do it, but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file, such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something. I'm not sure about this, as I have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the filename). ALSO....your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less. These specs rule out some of the good .bmp's. I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory. Finally, REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before, and put your new win.com in the windows directory. Also, don't start windows from a directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start. Share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (PF). Mickey	2

After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. I have, however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to. I have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy. I would appreciate any information, as I would like, once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.	2

I am setting up my DOS/UNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive and was wondering about the use of the (MS-DOS 5.0) JOIN command. I like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C: D: & E: (crap) that DOS enforces. I like how it would mimic mount points of UNIX filesystems. I have heard that there were problems with using it, or at least under older versions of DOS. Please tell!	2
I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to find out drive performance and these are the values I got Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec 14.5ms avg seek 3.7ms track to track Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec 12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track. First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values are. What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap file speed test program out there? Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all why I should load this driver? Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.	2

Source for "does not" comment: the CD-ROM and manuals for the March beta -- there *is* no X windows server there. Will there be? Of course. (Even) if Microsoft supplies one with NT, other vendors will no doubt port their's to NT.	2
To windows 3.0, yes. It's definitely dated - I used OS/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was developing it...) I preferred Windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0, but could still run more apps than OS/2 (again I made this choice before 2.0 was released). No, I've seen no such data. hee hee. good one ;> ;> ...and one that I've encountered as well... Hmm. Are you sure? I'm speaking from my own experience as an OS/2 _user_. Certainly people in, say, the NT marketing group would be in a unique position to present the results of, say, research on upcoming NT and OS/2 apps (vs Windows and MS-DOS apps). Part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does not mean one has access to such data (if it exists). I will confess to, at times, attacking the poster. Again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell" readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads" philosophy of usenet). Nor do we necessarily have access to info that others have. I also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like, members of the BORG. -jen --	2

You can't customize a command line interface? Where have you been? I can change the prompt, I can make aliases (so someone like me who is used to say, ls, can type it on my dos machine and still get a directory listing), and under Unix, if I don't like the command line interface, I throw it out and get a different one. (csh, bash, ksh, sh, etc...) This is true. A decent GUI for all variations of Unix? Lessee... what about Motif? Or the stuff from MIT? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty standard. Heck, an xwindows program runs like it likes to -- all the end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows with the mouse, and since it is a GUI, it's *graphical* and a bit easier to figure out. (Something the windows people have been pressing down our throats for some time now...) The thing I fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users running windows (all flavors) and the other "power" users running Unix and other more advanced OSes. At least right now, DOS is still pretty much king. I can bring a copy of my latest whiz-bang programming demo over to my friends house, and since we both run DOS, he can enjoy it too.	2
I've been using Windows NT (tm) since the October release, and I have to say that the March release is really a big improvement. Windows NT (tm) is becomming usable. There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though. First (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box. What I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS box. It absolutley crawls. And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM. If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), please let me know. The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff. For instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster (which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn't produced drivers yet. Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and give the rest over to Windows NT (tm). The only thing is, whenever you wanted to run Windows programs, you'd have to reboot and log into Windows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN. Windows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows though. It'd be a good choice if you have the resources. You should really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though. One last thing, modems work well enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I've never heard of anyone else who did either. It's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box, whereas with UNIX there isn't the same availablity. I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint of heart, it's still a beta. But it's a very GOOD beta. --	2
Hello All! It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you have hundreds of them as I do. First off, am I correct in this thinking - secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the applications that need fonts? Any ideas? Chris	2

You don't, and never had to. That's what enhanced shells are for. Remember 4DOS and NDOS? I mean, come on, you can't expect DOS to cover everything from R1.0. Microsoft has other projects to work on. I don't think they deliberately crippled the project. On the other hand, it IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on top of DOS. I mean, you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC. With XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar you're still gonna need a fast processor. [Re: DOS's death] Except for the people who use DOS programs, which means about 75% or more of the business world.	2
It could also be that your shell is hogging the resources. For example, open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources with ndw 2.x as shell, then do the same with program manager, and see if it's the shell or the apps.	2

If you can't wait, then you can ftp a 6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is probably a lot slower than the final product.

I have been using the JOIN command for many years now, mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts. You will hear lots of people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command (a truely gnarly hack), but don't believe them. You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN. But, in Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears: "JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 session. This includes adding or removing joined drives from within Windows for Workgroups. We recommend that you do not use JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1." Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows. However, I have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been "mounted" using join. In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x. It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file. Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always). Then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it. Unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone. I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present. I used to join c:\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an "ls" on the c:\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir. (This is difficult to reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.) I think this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw DOS. So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like. Wouldn't it be real great to "mount" network drives (i.e. Z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters? Unfortunately, JOIN won't let you do it. There was talk on the net about a simple patch to let JOIN work on network drives, but I don't remember the source. It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters. I realize that MessDos was meant for casual, even ignorant users, so "mounting" all the drives in one file tree might be confusing. But, it looks like MS is going to carry this over into windows NT (another OS meant for casual, even igorant users -- NOT!). With all it's old family system baggage, maybe MS needs a recovery group so they can get on with life :-(.	2
On all 1.44Mb drives (both Mac and PC), the disk spins at a constant RPM. On 800k Mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks. A PC needs special controller hardware to make this happen.	2

It has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing budgets that MS do. 4DOS, for instance, is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been (but never could be under MS). Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine. But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales. It seems to have worked pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine. That's okay, marketing isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way. They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does. If MS really gave a damn, they could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology. DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements. The "mediocre" was excusable in the early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years to play with it. An interesting thought on that: Most MS products that I'm aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens, including Windows, or at least have the names buried in the files. Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?	2
Really when you come down to it who cares. I just hope MS keeps doing what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses. Thx Dave L	2

Sorry, I don't have the demo, but I do have the program and have been using it for the past few weeks. Since I now have Dos 6 as well, I don't use many of the features of PCT4Win. But I do so use: - the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in folders, and multiple desktops - the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.	2

I agree that this should be added to some sort of FAQ list. But we have strayed from the original topic. Our computer environment is pretty split between Mac's and PC's... I am lucky and get to have both on my desk. But there are people who have PC's and need to share data with the Mac users here. The MAC users have no problems because of package called DOS Mounter which AUTOMATICALLy lets the MAC read DOS disks natively. For the PC there is no equivilant... that I know of! Both mac-ette and macsee have been inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity in a DOS program to selectively transport the files. The question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into windows like a .DLL that will interpret the reading of a MAC disk when it is in a PC, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs. It is quite clear that this would only be available for the 1.44MB flopies. -- T.J. Fiske	2

Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with output as a Postscript file. Later, I would like to take this Postscript file to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the document at 600 dots per inch resolution. I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from an image processing program that can output images in Postscript. Here's the problem: the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv) doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi. In fact, the setup dialog for this driver does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the menu is 300! Not a really useful menu. Any ideas?	2
Yep, you can use any type of UNIX, or maybe VMS, or buy a MAC or something... If you want longer filenames for your documents, I heard of a wordprocessor for windows which let you assign long names to files. Those long filenames could only be seen from that programs open/save dialogs though... Maybe someone knows more about this wordprocessor than I do?	2
Less than 1/2 of mailorder price! I have three libraries, all on CD, which cost me over two thousand dollars mail order. They are all genuine, high quality EPS vector graphics (NOT just some scans with a silly EPS wrapper!) They are: 1. Totem Graphics color EPS library (about 1400 color EPS images). This costs a thousand bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as high quality (much better than Dynamic Graphics clip art, SOTMC clip art, etc., in my opinion), but I rate both the 3G library and the C.A.R. library as higher. Totem's art is ALL color -- whereas most of the other's are B&W. It's the best all-color library out there, in my opinion. 2. C.A.R. Graphics library (haven't counted how many images, but you can purchase the library on 48 floppies, to give you an idea of the size). This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as very high quality, but it's only B&W. 3. 3G Graphics library (very popular in all the Mac mags). This costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. I rate this clip art as very high quality (got some awards in one of the major Mac mags, forgot which). Some of the images are color, but most are B&W. For what it's worth, all three of the CD's are saved in multiple file formats. They are readable on Mac's and PC's. Additionally, Totem's will mount native- NeXT also, although the NeXT could just as easily mount either the Mac or PC filesystems. I've personally tested the CD's on all three machines (I've owned all three machines, although I sold my NeXT a few months ago). Also, in my opinion, the 3G and C.A.R. libraries are the best in the business (and I've seen lots). Also, Totem's is, in my opinion, the best all-color library around, although I like 3G's color art better. I want $850 for everything. Can ship certified check C.O.D., as well as VISA/MC charge. If you pay by VISA/MC, I'll ship pre-paid in the continental U.S. If I ship C.O.D., buyer pays freight and C.O.D. fee. Reason for selling: No longer have DTP business.

Has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you done to cure it?

From then on other workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf again.	2

I've been using Final from CODA for some time, but suddenly it stopped using my fonts. I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript laser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do some work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a rather important font :-) I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the [Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't work; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file everything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs to work with. And yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are listed, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. Has anyone encountered problems like this? What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1 Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400? I'd be grateful for all hints and help. -mats	2

Hi. One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem. His mouse works fine in DOS applications, if you load them from the C: prompt. Under Windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move. Even if you load a DOS app under Windows, the mouse doesn't work. The computer is a Zeos 386SX-20 w/Diamond Speedstar VGA running MS DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1. Mouse driver is Microsoft's 8.2. I've tried switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2, I've tried a different mouse, I've reinstalled MOUSE.DRV, and I can't get the blamed thing to work. The only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional parallel and serial port. Could that cause the problem? Thanks in advance for any help.	2

I don't think the question is: "will OS/2 X.X run Windows Y.Y apps now?" A more important question is: "will subsequent OS/2 versions continue to run apps from subsequent Windows versions in the future?" Can it keep up? Will a future OS/2 3.0 run Windows 4 apps? OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come. After this fall, I believe IBM no longer has any rights to view Microsoft code. After that, the only way to maintain some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer. Would you want to reverse-engineer an OLE2 application?	2
I saw an ad for this and it basically is an advanced print manager... it lets you monitor your printing more closely and comes with a bunch of True type fonts... anyone have this? Good? Bad? Worth it?	2
Wow, what did you use it for? Single-tasked word processing? I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-MB virtual machine (12MB of RAM). My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a floppy in the background. Many unix people love OS/2 because they are used to multi-tasking systems. Too bad they hold a gun to the mouse piper while they throw mice at their "new" trap, trying to get it to work. :) ---------------------------------------------	2
Its my understanding that bus mice are more accurate and "stable" in general than serial mice. If I remember correctly, its because of the differences in how the interrupts are handled, as well as the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus as opposed to a (9600 bps?) serial connection.	2
Make sure you use the small fonts driver & not the large fonts driver. Check that in your setup. That's the only explanation I would find. Hope this helps	2
Hello, I want a little network for 3 users. All users want to run Windows. The most important things I want for the network are: file-sharing, mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem card on one of the computers. We all want to use each others harddisk. My idea was to buy three computers (one 486DX and two 386DX). All three have a 40Mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large harddisk. All three also have a network card. The 486 is connected to the printers and contains the fax/modem card. And last but not least: Workgroups for Windows. My questions: - Is this possible? - What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups for Windows? - Will all the computers be fast enough? Behind all three, someone is working.	2
This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN Notepad and Paintbrush before printing? If you just want to drag a file (.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.	2

It will certainly *help* to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but the only way that Solaris or OS/2 or any other scheme is going to challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris or OS/2 or whatever apps, down to a DOS competitive level. Everybody would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS/2 app on an OS/2 system, they usually just can't afford a Unix system because of the high prices for good Unix software.	2
I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode. For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted. The rest of the desktop is fine. For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I have no problem. I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no problems with, so it is possible. It is also possible to display these bitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video card is not at fault. How can I remedy this? My system: 386DX40, 4Mb ram.

OK, now you are starting to define your criteria. I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that. You have shown that some aspects of MSW3.1 are technically inferior to other systems. As I said earlier, if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true. But some aspects of MSW3.1 are actually technically superior to each of the other systems (resource requirements, performace, device support, printer support, GUI etc.) [ BTW, I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIX/X is as easy to learn as Windows! ] But I might even agree that, on balance, MSW3.1 is technically inferior to some of the competition. This still does not prove your point. Range of available applications? Base OS cost? Cost of applications? Cost of hardware? Multi-platform support? Quality of the after-sales service? Availability of books/training materials? Support for visual and physical handicaps? Suitability for use in mobile computing? Quality of Documentation?	2
[much BS deleted for brevity] It certainly smacks of that! Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with DOS 6.0? Care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? That post sure looked like FUD....and coming from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level. Advocacy is GOOD - but spreading FUD to advocate your favorite OS is very unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that OS. That is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more defensive people in my life. Moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage this too, IMHO. Seriously speaking, it is a shame that MS techie employees get the heat for MS's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the Management and marketing. I am sure that they ARE very talented etc ... I have not doubts about their abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices. Divya -- Divya	2

Personally, I'll be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing what it does so well, I hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. I'd hate to be one who actually does innovate, and then have Microsoft come in like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff, marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. I don't have all that much sympathy for Apple's complaint against Microsoft, since they just took the ideas from Xerox's PA Research Center when the Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over antitrust fears. However, for other companies and individuals who have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from the original innovator, I feel much sympathy.

I replied: You answered: I think it is important to clear up your first reply. You gave the impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker. You are correct re: caching the compressed drive. However, as I understand it, you can cache the uncompressed drive. Thus if you have compressed your disk C:, you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker. C being the compressed disk (which is just a large file on D:) and D being the uncompressed disk. You should only attempt to stack D:. In fact, with Win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default to stacking your A,B and D drives.	2

I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch of mail as "foo.txt ." I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load "foo.txt" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course pose file name contention problems. What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword that would move "foo.txt" to a specified directory, rename it using the current date and time, and delete the original "foo.txt ." In other words, "foo.txt" gets renamed as "5012300", say, on May 1 at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and "foo.txt" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec macro points to it. My main question is this: How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a time/date variable in the new filename?

Very well indeed. At home (a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro) I can stretch an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly. It drops a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean one frame update every 30 seconds. An ISA Graphics+ was able to do "Zoom by 2" without any perceptible performance penalty. It is the best performance I've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board (which uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA bus at any point).	2

NeXTSTep --easier to learn, use, and program. More stable multitasking UNIX/X --As easy to learn and use. More stable multitasking. With the prpoer setup, all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as well as MSW machines will amongst themselves, so interoperability is not an issue. By this criterion, it is inferior. If you have another, then perhaps I am incorrect. Do you pick up the glove?	2

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ If JD Power and Associates did the survey, I would like an anonymous ftp site to pick it up at. Only a sucker believes an MS released survey results about an MS product. Ok--assume that the results of the survey, whatever they are, are 100% honest. If the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with the product, is MS going to tell us to stop buying MS-DOS 6.0 because it sux? :-) Sure.... Well, these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some microscopic weight to MS' arguments. As I just said, you have seen what automakers do. Who is going to believe Chrysler if they tell us, "In a 'random' Chrysler-conducted survey..." My theory about certain people is that they are convinced that if a point is maintained long enough, it is true. After all, what is the focus of this company? Information. Money and information. Technology is, for some, an expedient toward these ends. Why did Bill Gates drop out of college? Was it because he couldn't afford it at the time? Was it because (as the WSJ says) he couldn't wait to use what he knew to go out and make money? Bill Gate's answer to this question would be highly interesting. I await it. I can't stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and using every available opportunity to build up the cult around himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze as their main stays. ---------------------------------------------	2

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my hands on PC-Solaris...Unix for the Intel chip! I know that there are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes the Wabi (Windows API Binary Interface...I think) technology that wil run Windows apps straight outta da box. If this flies in enhanced mode, then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education market. Too big and complex for the home front...Windows 4/Mac Sys7 will take those while Win4Wkgrps - NT - OS/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses. However, once the PowerPC becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form) then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix machine at work and yet still run Windows/Mac apps at home is going to be real attractive to alot of people!!! Just my predictions. Mike	2
It's the applications that do this. Unfortunately, even the applets that ship with Win31 seem to have this problem (I've seen it in Solitaire, for example). None that I know of. If an application doesn't give back the resources, they are lost and gone forever, pending a restart of Windows. If the applications don't free up the memory (and a lot of them don't), there's bugger all that any other piece of software can do about it. No. This is a problem with the applications, usually. There are books written on this one. In general, just be sure to free up everything that you ask for before you exit. Unfortunately, I understand that VB will *internally* lose resources for you, so there's no way to avoid this entirely. There's little discussion because it's 'inevitable' until MS manages to come up with an OS that will do garbage collection or something on the resource pool. -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	2

Actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops mainstream DOS and Windows apps develops them under DOS or Windows. PC Week recently printed a rumor that Microsoft's Excel development group does its development under OS/2. Another trade rag did an article recently about a group doing Windows development on Sun SPARCstations with SoftPC to test out their work. SCO Unix is and has been a reasonably popular development platform for DOS, Windows, and even OS/2 apps. DOS and Windows are simply not robust or stable enough for development work, IMHO, and apparently others agree.	2
I prefer InfoSelect myself, but it is a strange kind of PIM. Well, a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better. 1) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon. That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. You can drag files between windows, to any icon on the tree on the left side of the window, and to any drive icon. This beats your "left and right window" as you can have as many open as you wish instead of just two. 2) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking on the executable's icon. 3) You can launch any application and open a document file by double clicking on the document file's icon, provided you have associations set correctly. This is easily done with the menus. The "browse" capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. So if you name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF, TIFF, etc. files towards Paintshop or WinGIF, this takes care of your requirement for "text reading and graphics viewing". I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell. Setting up all the associations you need is the way to do it. If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be pretty good indeed! File Manager just needs you to understand how some things are done. --	2

The May issue of PC/Computing page 246 has a Windows hint and tips for just this thing. You have to edit the WIN.INI file and add a couple of lines. I tried it and it works. I actually made my Title bar and iconized text, and icon text smaller. On my monitor it works well. You can select a larger font also. You edit the WIN.INI file with a font name in your system directory. Read the article because I would not want to retype it here in case I type errored and caused your system problems.

By night I'm an Amiga user. By day I work with windows. I'd be much more comfortable in windows if I had Two things. 1. A good Personal information manager. You know- a calendar, address book, reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface. 2. A good file manager. Microsofts is very poor by my standards. How about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing.

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS (and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2. The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the wayside. Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS 3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows. Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will offer even more in terms of "real" OS features (I work on NT and have no real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a few years ago). ...Dave	2

In my situation vi is very powerful and I'm searching to a vi editor for Windows.... Bye p.s. sorry for the bad english....	2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Not unreasonable, since the SMARTDRV packaged with DOS 6 is version 4.1. Make sure that all your drivers (HIMEM, EMM386, SMARTDRV) are being executed from the DOS directory. Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem; if not, I don't know what might cause the startup delay. My testbed for DBLSPACE (which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE) boots in about 20 seconds from the "Starting MS-DOS" herald to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT execution. I don't have handy a system with a more realistic volume of data to time.	2
No. No. No, but... You can allocate real static data within code segments! When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap. You can forget most of what was written about memory management. Under 3.1 you have paged virtual memory. You can lock every block without hampering the memory manager. You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock/ Unlocking the memory block. An besides: DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's, that happen to be called by another task. Karl.	2

I have the same problem with a Diamond Stealth VRAM card. Daniel> .	2
I would expect the EISA board to be more than twice as fast as the ISA board. Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses. Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4. EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card. So I guess, for me, the question is unanswered still. I would expect him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does not. -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	2

Lotus Organizer!!! Quick, cheap, pretty! And has all of those features you want ... You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third parties. Norton Desktop for Windows, for instance. Personally, I *like* File Manager, which comes with Windows. It's much faster than NDW's, and the File Manager that's part of Windows for Workgroups even has a decent button bar. That first you can do with File Manager, but the others you'll need to look at NDW or PC Tools for Windows, etc. I haven't yet seen a decent freeware or even shareware shell. But it may be just me.	2

Are you sure you want to do that? If a win app locks up for some reason, ctrl-alt-del may be the only way to kill the app and get back to Windows. Granted it doesn't work all that often but it has come in handy on occasion. I consider it pretty carefully before I disabled that keystroke. Just a thought.	2
Hello again, About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers. Specifically, a comparison between the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500. Many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I received. Below is my original query and the responses I received. I have not deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so you can extract what you find necessary. Some people asked me for an unbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer. There are a wide range of comments, each has its own value. There was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its price/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background). Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around summertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first inkjet). You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer). No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will print, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets (laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge). Well, that's a brief research summary of my personal research. ENJOY! =========================================================================== Well I bought the BJ 200 about a month ago at the start of their $50 rebate program on that printer (it ends 5/31), and I bought it from Computer Discount Warehouse because their price of $325 couldn't be beat anywhere I looked, and I think it's a HOT printer. Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode. I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200. Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the HP has 2.5M ram installed. I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows). I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders too. If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239. Delivery to NY was two days. Good luck! Craig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com Motorola Communications & Electronics Inc. Glen Rock, NJ =========================================================================== I own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard' photo-copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality 'distinction' type paper things look better. For most applications I find copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix. Comes with a Windows driver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few 'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType but haven't really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother. The RAM cartridges can't be used as buffer - soft fonts only. For graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as 'scatter', 'pattern' etc. The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed. Text is not so good in this mode. Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text. The range of tones for graphic images isn't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general. However, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from Epson. This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing laser-like quality on normal copier paper. Can't remember the model #, LX - something I think? I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{. The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand. =========================================================================== About a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200. I absolutely LOVE it. It is incredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don't know if you ever do stuff with that or not.) Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text. The only problems I've had are printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on cheap paper (lots of streaks). Normal copy paper works great with it, you can only tell it's not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve inches from your face. (That is, if you're nearsighted, like me! :) ) The printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!! I have no other complaints. The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that haven't written a driver for it yet. The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it between now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!! I bought mine from a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340. I have a friend who has the HP you are looking at. It also prints very well, and everyone has drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow! Hope I helped! (360dpi sure looks great!) Heather Stehman =========================================================================== I guess I have some experience with both: I have a BJ-300 at work and a Deskjet 500 at home. I prefer the Deskjet. The printing speed and quality are similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home). The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications. The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time. The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs. Just my $0.02 worth.. -- Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto P.O. Box 174 Luling, LA 70070 INTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com =========================================================================== Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the translation. I actually thought of some other points after I posted the note. The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the Bubblejet does not. You are right about the graphics resolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to: Wordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and could not tell a difference. In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down. The Bubblejet did not. I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there. Finally, I wanted sheet feeding. In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet. I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own money. BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at work this month anyway. Regards Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling, LA =========================================================================== I spent some time comparing the two. We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ-200 versus the HP. Our reasons were: 1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon 2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference 3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment. The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the BJ-200 feeder. The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think. As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200. We haven't done anything big with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows. I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer, but I don't know how it compares (also the driver included with the printer is Canon's whereas I don't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from - Microsoft?) Hope this helps. -- Thomas V. Frauenhofer, WA2YYW tvf@cci.com, ...!uunet!uupsi!cci632!tvf, tvf@cs.rit.edu Mandlebratwurst: The Meal that Eats Itself! =========================================================================== Altough I'm sometimes also a salesperson (if I'm not suppost to study :-)) I would recommend to buy the BJ200. The printing quality is a bit better, but you you've got much more possiblities. Don't forget the HP engine is at least 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in other "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently available.. I've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers) 2 times the same picture, one printed with the BJ200, one with the Canon, the other with the HP, and.. there was a difference in printing- quality,.. The Canon was a bit better.. Greetz, Kris =========================================================================== When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers. They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet. We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s. I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print quality. The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal). Anyway, we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. Out of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by HP. -Nate =========================================================================== Whenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. I've been unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers. I can't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. I bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that). Although I haven's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the result. I note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still readily available (at least in the UK). The following are my views/experience: 1. I don't know anything about the Canon except that I came away from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio. 2. I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the ideal place to be but the market's still young so one assumes they have the expertise. 3. The 500C is worth the extra. Operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from Windows. 4. I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured typesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!) and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor... 5. The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers. 6. If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it's pretty slow with it, God knows what it's like without! I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it's not in daily use. I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it's easy peasy to operate. Hope this is of use. Regards David =========================================================================== Just bought the BJ-200. I thought the price couldn't be beat ($329, with $50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the DeskJet in print quality. Speed: Per page rate seems to be faster (I don't have figures). I don't print long docs, though. Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent. Print quality is excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet. The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page/print head in place, I would imagine. Large docs: Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ... manual says up to 100, though. Haven't tried it. Drivers: No problems under Win3.1 yet. WinWord doesn't want to print the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though. Know nothing of add-on costs. Daniel A. Hartung -- dhartung@chinet.chinet.com -- Ask me about Rotaract =========================================================================== I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago. I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me. The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper). I don't have problems with the ink not being dry, it seems to dry VERY fast. Probably within a second. Since Canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy. --- Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications =========================================================================== Wow, it's funny you should ask this. I'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be late. I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night. I was really worried that I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level is fantastic! I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser quality. You can't tell it's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page. no problems with drivers. The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn't findi it under Windows or WordPerfect. It works well under both. I have yet to install Word for Windows so don't know how it works with them. I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year. It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully slow. And much noisier than the BubbleJet. I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more. Just my $0.02 worth. -=- Brett =========================================================================== -- Sincerely, Robert Kayman ---- kayman@cs.stanford.edu -or- cpa@cs.stanford.edu	2
< rest deleted > As a followup to my post let me add that: I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance. However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from within an interactive SAS session. The user site can enter their site-specific "batch profile" into a dataset within our product, specifying the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options, etc. At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file. Then I exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted. The batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session. As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80 characters. But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in batch mode requires more than 80 characters. Up til NT this has not been a problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg. MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is *STANDARD* with OS/2). The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT. Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT. And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with NT. I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like "Is vi available for Windows?") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and ***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT. What is that product? Is it a separate product or part of Windows? ksh would do what I need if I could count on it at all NT sites. One last question: I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities, i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there. If these are native NT commands rather than network specific commands, this would also help me improve this process. If you can comment on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Hello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an X-server on top of windows would do very well.

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 3.1 to open a dos box. When I am done with the dos box, I cant get back to windows. If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes black and I have to control-alt-delete until I kill windows. I get a couple of screens about app not responding. I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alt-tab to cycle through the running apps, I get flashes of text but then the black returns. This persists even if the machine is powered on and off. I am working with an app developed using Borland's 3.1 application frameworks and c++. It seems to work fine. Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network. Video is a TSENG vga. dos 5.0. I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back. I am using temporary swapping for virtual memory. I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer. Thanks,	2

Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS. I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.	2

InfoWorld (April 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with DOS 6. A 'Second Look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.

Seen from a typographically point of view, ATM using PostScript fonts is better than TrueType; the hinting mechanism incorporated in PS is gorgeous. Multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in a PS font as problematically; they may have better use of the Unicode features of TT fonts (in Windows NT). I've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size PS fonts; I haven't seen those as TT fonts. Most of them are rendering quite inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts). Simply compare TimesNewRoman as a PS font with the TT font; the first looks better. I am hoping that there will be ATM/NT !	2

Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate spaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw. Our editors need to be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box. They overlap each other and characters on each side, which is useless. I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this. I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!! Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? Has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a CorelDraw TTF?	2

PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors. Where: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1 33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA When: Wednesday, May 5th 7 pm to 9 pm NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now, only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a "Hot Prospect". Now, NeXT is nearing release of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and Motorola hardware. NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression 486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo in San Francisco. The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by! For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of PC Magazine, page 66.

I have a 486/33 VLB machine, with a Wang 96/24 fax/modem. When using the windows terminal application, the only way I can get it to 'see' the modem is to change it to COM2, then go back and change it to COM4. Then it works fine. (I have it set to COM4 as the port to use) I don't have anything plugged into COM2, and I've looked over the manual for all it's worth, but what am I missing? The modem is jumpered for COM4/IRQ3, which I understand means I can't use the second serial port and the modem at the same time, but I'm not using the second serial port anyway. Also, when using Procomm + for DOS, it always sees the modem and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end answers. Don't know if that helps any. Thanks,	2

I have an EISA machine and I just do not understand why most EISA video cards only match the performance of their ISA counterparts. For instance, the EISA Orchid Pro Designer IIs-E is only about as "fast" as the ISA Diamond SpeedStar Plus, which isn't what I would call "fast." I don't understand why EISA video cards aren't, as a group, on the same level of performance as Local Bus cards, given that EISA video cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of ISA's 8 bits. Since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board, such as a Diamond SpeedStar 24X? From PC Magazine's (I think) recent report, I know that ATI makes a pretty fast EISA video card, but it's around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend. And, for $500, I could get a Diamond Viper and still have $100 left over (of course, I'd have to get a Local Bus mother- board too...) Can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?	2

This may be an FAQ (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but I am getting frustrated and looking for help. I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close them. When I load windows I start with about 83% resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly (WPWIN 5.2, VB 2.0, WINQVT 2.8, Lotus Organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when I exit them. After a day or two of work I often find myself down under 50% of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell running. I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it. 1. What software is the culprit? Win 3.1, NDW, my applications? Are some modes of Win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at plugging this leak? 2. Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak? 3. Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this? Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM. 4. If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside? (I was hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.) 5. When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources? 6. Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for specifically? Thanks for your help. As this is a common problem and I have seen only a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending me email.	2

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but I've used the shareware program, PaintShop, to convert between the two. You can download it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but I don't know what the file is called or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try scanning the index files). To convert a .BMP file to a .RLE file, you just load the .BMP file and do a "Save as..." Select "Windows bitmap" and "Compressed" (or is it "RLE"?) Whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive... Sorry I don't have all the details, but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb terminal and can't do much researching...Good luck!	2

The format for Word for Windows doc files is available from Microsoft. Call their Developer Support Services number (sorry, don't have it handy) and ask for the Word for Windows binary file format spec. Warning: It is not terribly useful, and you will need to do a *lot* of looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored. General primer: Word for Windows stores its data in two chunks. The first chunk is the actual text in the file. This is all stored together and has nothing but text and graphics. The second chunk is the formatting information. For general use, to read a Word for Windows file, skip the first 384 bytes of the file (its a general header). Then read the remaining text until you hit binary data.	2

It depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that comes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager. Well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the item by clicking once on it, click on 'File' and then on 'Properties'. You should see a box which says 'Change icon'. Click on it. You are going to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). If you don't like any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file 'moricons.dll' Select it. Browse through the icons presented, and just double click on your desired icon. If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager, say iconPower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace. When you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change. And thats it! regards ___________________________________________________________________________	2

I have the following problem on a Dell 450SE with the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro EISA: When I start Windows, the first 5 times I try to run an application, it does not start. Windows will show the following error message: Error Executing application. There is not enough memory to run the application. After the first 5 tries, the application I want to run will start, and afterwards there are no more problems. When I change the Video driver from Mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so I suspect the ATI drivers (I tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver). Does anyone have a clue?	2

It was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it. Note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know about that, or... When I heard those numbers I wondered how they got them (having worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller has very little positive to say about the product, I figured it wasn't from there...) so I wandered over to the marketing folks and asked. And I was told it was from a survey of registered users. And I posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came from. Hmm. I figured, if Chuck posted the numbers, why not include where they came from? (I also find it interesting that postitive info is "fear, uncertainty & doubt".) ???? I think you've got me confused with someone else. I don't pretend that MSDOS provides what all people need, or that other OSes (including unix & OS/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary features. I also don't push people to use MSDOS; I even posted in comp.os.msdos.misc that I suggest _waiting_ before installing a new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded during release, unless the sales are a total bomb). I ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. Do you *really* think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it? I just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie cutter. We don't all think alike. Yeah, ChuckSt and I have some "inside" info on MSDOS - doesn't mean that everyone else does :) -jen --	2
I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A. Turned off smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc. This same disk aborts Norton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be run when attempting to defrag drive. At Some peoples' suggestion I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from scratch. A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1 beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this drastic solution. When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive. I get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro. when I get the message, I run file manager and copy the offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp. Then I quit and restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.) This really sucks. But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the drive (especially with the NSD problem). I will be going with out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while the guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and either fixes it or replaces the drive. I can't wait to have a system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!	2

It came from a reseller survey. I don't recall any FUD here. Maybe an example? For the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented. Microsoft has been attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc. ANYONE would get defensive when being baselessly attacked. We are human beings as well. You should expect a response when a claim that an employee might feel is unwarranted is leveled.	2
It does sound funny, I will admit. But for me it is true. Windows crashed on all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception) . OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or (generally) anything they aren't supposed to have. If windows works for you, then great. Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of choice. If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the key reasons for using OS/2 are gone. I probably would still use it, but it would be more of an even fight. Brett	2

From article <C68uBG.K2w@world.std.com>, by cfw@world.std.com (Christopher F Wroten): Good question. Answer: The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA's 8/(16?) But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus. I think that's either 8 or 10 mhz. The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA, but they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz. So, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz, and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz. So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu. EISA should be about two (maybe 3) times as fast as ISA. That's a very good question. The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it's width. For example: more/better interrupts and bus mastering. But these other factors do not impact a video card very much. They have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.	2

I am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode. The sound card I have is the ATI Stereo F/X-CD sound card which claims Adlib and Soundblaster compatibility. Using Windows MediaPlayer, I can play the midi files that came with my sound card. However, I can't play any of the midi files that belong to the WinJammer midi editor that I ftp'd from cica. I also can't play any midi files I generate with muzika (also from cica). When I try to play the files, a dialog box pops up saying that the music may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable this message in the future. Is this normal, or do I have something set wrong? I would really like to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it. I also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music won't play either - I get the same dialog box. The MIDI Mappers that I have are ATI Ext MIDI, ATI OPL3 MIDI, and Vanilla.

Kinsman Precambrian Electronics 29 Falstaff Rd. Rochester, NY 14609 thomask@kodak.com Copyright March 15, 1991 ABSTRACT The format of images created for use by MS Windows 3.0/3.1 applications is documented in the MS Windows Programmer's Reference guide. This guide is intended as a clearify some wording of the specifications, and to put forth a recommendation among the various alternatives. Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions to me. Please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document. Thank you for your respect. This document Copyright, 1991, by Thomas B. Kinsman. If desired, a PostScript version of this document is available. This information is free. You get more than what you pay for. Don't sue me if I'm wrong. OVERVIEW The DIB image file format is intended to be a "Device Independent Bitmap" file format. (What Microsoft means by "Device Independent" is unclear to me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit pixels. These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems. If you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte- swap all short and long integer values. By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP". This is because March 15, 1991 - 2 - they are a super-set of earlier "bitmap image files". Consequently you will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files. Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors" of DIB images: o DOS DIB images. These are the recommended convention, and the form which I will describe how to create. They are intended for applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment. o OS/2 DIB images. My understanding is that these are the flavor of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager. o Old-style Bitmap images. March 15, 1991 - 3 - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS The DOS DIB images consist of: 1. A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file. This header also gives the total size of the image file, and the offset to the image data. 2. A "BITMAPINFOHEADER" image header which specifies the image attributes. 3. An optional palette of colors used by the image. If it exists, this may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. Each entry is a Windows RGBQUAD structure. 4. The image data itself. The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 1. The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as a DIB file. This header also gives the total size of the image file, and the offset to the image data. 2. A "BITMAPCOREHEADER" image header which specifies the image attributes. 3. An optional palette of colors used by the image. Again, if this exists it may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries. Each entry is a Windows RGBTRIPLE structure. 4. The image data itself. The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 1. Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a BITMAPCOREHEADER. Which header type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value. 2. An optional color palette. This palette may be composed of either Windows RGBQUAD structures (if the header was a BITMAPINFOHEADER) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures (if the header was a BITMAPCOREHEADER). 3. The image data itself. CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES. Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward steps. The headers need to be created and then written to the file. These header structures are defined in the MS Windows/3.0 "windows.h" include file. Palette information needs to be stored for images that are not 24-bit images. The five general steps are: 1. Filling in the BITMAPFILEHEADER and the BITMAPINFOHEADER structures the basic image information. 2. If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image, creating the color palette of RGBQUADS. 3. Calculating the total file size and putting this information in March 15, 1991 - 4 - the "bfSize" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 4. Calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file, and putting this in the "bfOffBits" field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER. 5. Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER, the BITMAPINFOHEADER, the color palette, and the image data (in that order). The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft C type- defined keywords. The following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with MicroSoft C. _______________________________________ | | | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.| |______________________________________| | typedef | meaning | |_________|____________________________| | BYTE | unsigned character | | WORD | two byte unsigned integer | | DWORD | four byte unsigned integer| |_________|____________________________| March 15, 1991 - 5 - THE BITMAPFILEHEADER This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD bfType; DWORD bfSize; WORD bfReserved1; WORD bfReserved2; DWORD bfOffBits; } BITMAPFILEHEADER; The "bfType" field is the two ascii characters 'B' and 'M'. This serves to identify the file as a DIB image file. On an intel byte ordered machine (IBM or a compatible), this constant can be formed in C as the quantity ('M' << 8 | 'B') == 0x4d42 on an intel system. The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file. For our purposes this field is equal to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD, plus the number of bytes of image data. If the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be calculated ahead of time. Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in later. Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2" fields are always set to zero. The "bfOffBits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file. For our purposes, this field should be set to: the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER, plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER, plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD. This works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists. March 15, 1991 - 6 - THE BITMAPINFOHEADER This structure is defined in "windows.h" as: typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER{ DWORD biSize; DWORD biWidth; DWORD biHeight; WORD biPlanes; WORD biBitCount; DWORD biCompression; DWORD biSizeImage; DWORD biXPelsPerMeter; DWORD biYPelsPerMeter; DWORD biClrUsed; DWORD biClrImportant; } BITMAPINFOHEADER; The "biSize" field is set to the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself. When reading the image file, this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a BITMAPINFOHEADER and not a BITMAPCOREHEADER. The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels. The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines. The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1. This data is written out as if there was one color plane. The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image. This must be either 1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data. The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed. DIB images support two forms of run-length encoding. However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how it works. Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the data is not compressed. All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure may be set to zero. A requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information. The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed". For 4-bit and 8-bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains "biClrUsed" colors. If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries. Generally, set this field to zero. March 15, 1991 - 7 - COLOR PALETTES Each entry of a color palette is a RGBQUAD structure. The RGBQUAD structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as: typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE rgbBlue; BYTE rgbGreen; BYTE rgbRed; BYTE rgbReserved; } RGBQUAD; The "rgbReserved" field is always zero. For each color used, the amount of Blue, Green, and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file. A value of zero in the "rgbBlue", "rgbGreen", or "rgbRed" fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition. A value of 255 in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition. IMAGE DATA There are three surprises about the ordering of image data in DIB image file. The creator of this format was determined to be creative, and certainly was. Within the image data, each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity. So, if you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every image line. The number of bytes per line can be calculated as: bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4; ---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure--- bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4; When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first. The bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file. For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written as you would expect. One bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte. Four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte. Eight bit images are written one pixel per byte. Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel. However, for 24-bit images the information must be written out in the order blue, green, red. While most image file formats write data out in March 15, 1991 - 8 - an "RGB" ordering, a DIB image file writes the data out in an "BGR" ordering. SUMMARY This should provide enough information to create DIB images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines. If you find out any more about DIB images, please pass the information on to me so that I can modify this document accordingly. March 15, 1991 -- Thomas B.

: So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize : quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them : that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has : done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot : easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world : but that will not change their perception. None of this changes the fact that MSW3.1 is objectively inferior to its competition. I have begun to learn in life that the masses never choose the best option available to them-- they choose the one which they have been conditioned to think is best. I'm glad I'm not one of them.	2

Well, I agree. I hope others chime in with suggestions on specific technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an Earth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft. Tim et al: I think we should try looking at atmosphere first. This seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive. We're all taught that when supporting a patient you look for maintaining airway. So, in keeping with my trauma training (and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy), I suggest that we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit. Howz that Tim?	14

Given that what i described for the HST seemed to be the SMT, and given the mass amrgins on the discovery mission is tight enough that spacewalking has to be carefully constrained..... No EDO pallets, no spare Suits, no extra MMU's. WHy not do this? Quick Test Goldins philosophjy of faster cheaper, better. Build a real fast Space TUg, to handle the re-boost of the HST using clean Cryo fuels, and get it ready before the HST mission. If NASA could build Mercury in 13 months, they should be able to make an SMT in 9. How much would it need? Guidance package. Use a Voyager spare. Thruster gear, Use H2O2, or LOX/LH. Bus Use a Commsat. Grapple fixture. Use a stripped down Canadarm. Comms package. SPare X-band omni gear.	14

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort. You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches. What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on investment. If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and the prize is just the icing on the cake. I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current US launchers. (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.) You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch system rather than pissing it away on existing ones. Being there first is of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it. I'm sure Spar would offer to develop such a lunar-tuned system and deliver a couple of them to you for only a couple of hundred million dollars.	14
Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years. They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored) which is five times cheaper than Shuttle. Allen	14
Sorry, you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky, but it isn't a right. When you get down to it, you actually have no rights that the majority haven't agreed to give you (and them in the process). It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with rights to this that and the other. Sadly this is not true. Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that _should_ go with the power to clutter the night sky, then that's a different matter.	14
In some sense, I think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful, and the folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are both right. That is, I think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone wants to try it out, more power to them. However, a company may discover that the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would gain might decide to bow out of the project. I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an "abomination." I don't think that word means what he thinks it does. Children starving in the richest country in the world is an abomination; an ad agency is at worst just in poor taste.	14
.. One thing to recall. Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing. Any misalignment of the plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will require more fuel to adjust. This was considered in the original deployment. I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous. One has to admire how much they are trying to do.	14
I'm replying to someone who asked for information on space camp. I have a brochure that has all different schedules. What age, what level and what program do you want to know the schedule of? Most of the missions are 5 to 8 days long. The address for Huntsville is: Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission U.S. Space and Rocket Center One Tranquility Base, Huntsville, AL 35807 - Jennifer	14
Obviously not. Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible. The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long? You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this. What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors (also as a function of photon energy). Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response. To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector, and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft. I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2 degrees.	14
Of course, How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s Process flow diagrams, Level 5 software projects.... actually come in on schedule and under Cost. I know the GAO determined that 80% of all NASA projects miss their budgets due to failing to adequately measure engineering developement costs. Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D. I thought Bell Labs was one of the best to do research. I don't think the government should pour money into any one sector, but should engage in projects which naturally push the state of the art. THings like High tech construction projects, apollo was worth it for the doing. Running hte national labs. The SSC is grossly overweight, but is a reasonable project at a lower cost. Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected. Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell new PH'ds, you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00 If you produce, you can qualify for other grants. If you don't you never get in again. THis way young people get a shot at reserach, and older stale scientists don't dominate the process.	14
How difficult would it be to do a solar sail mission to say mercury? Not much has been there and there is a 23?KM/s delta v to eat off. could a solar sail, handle say adiscovery bus, and drop it into mercury orbit, good enough for rockets to put it into some form of polar orbit?	14
From the description I've read, it's prob. only going to be as bright as Jupiter. Anything else is probably hype from the opponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors. If we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon, that cheap, the CIS would have done it already.	14
I disagree. It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist activity. Not one which he is ever going to participate in. Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation? I like the idea of the study, but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it. If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication. As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering the microworld isn't the problem. The problem is understanding the basic chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently. For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals. Food synthesis is not very far advanced. So we have to orbit a farm. Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt. This is where the engineering comes in. But new technologies bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to. Like, in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that. The lettuce growth is stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes. So now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions. This means some basic applied scientific research. And that's what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far. We also need to find out how they interact together. That's where we are now. First you need to do the literature search. There is a lot of information out there. Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation. This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net. Then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies. Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net, I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first. Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis. The data base itself could be useful for future engineers. That's my response Ken, what do you think?	14

This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no, anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference. That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution... Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars. Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but that uses pretty far-out physics. My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't rule out the Oort cloud. What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter? The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum. The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms. According to Trevor Weeks, if the "Tunguska Meteorite" was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well. The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them out. The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB's. If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort- cloud GRB's at all.	14
Wouldn't bother me. I'd laugh. It wouldn't work -- the surface of the Moon is *already* pretty dark, and the contrast would be so poor you couldn't possibly see it. The only reason the Moon looks bright is that it's in bright sunlight against an otherwise-dark sky. Evidently Heinlein didn't know that...	14
at least be honest. velcro (tm) dates from the 40's. i have doubts about everything listed above. just because it was developed in the space age, doesn't mean it was a space spin-off.	14
That's assuming it could get built by them. Of course, it would probably sport Cruise missile Racks, Sidewinder Missile tubes, Bomb Points, extra drop tanks, a Full ECM suite, Terrain following radar and stealth materials.

Okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?) Okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty.. Now the question. Can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it?? Can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical field? After all the dragless satellite is (I might be wrong), a suspended between to pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. I think I know what I want to say, just not sure how to say it.. A dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator. == Michael Adams, nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu -- I'm not high, just jacked	14
And from whence does this right stem, that it overrides the 'rights' of the rest of us? And if you want to view that television station, you have to watch the commercials. You can't turn them off and still be viewing the television station. In other words, if you don't like what you see, don't look. There is no 'right' I can think of that you have to force other people to conform to your idea of aesthetic behaviour. What's next, laws regulating how people must dress and look so as to appeal to your fashion sense, since you have this 'right' of an aesthetic view? Which has what to do with the topic of discussion? Oh, I see. You don't want any legislation that might impinge on you; you just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want. -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	14
Uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? Unless the state's buying... Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company of selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so. And any efficient lights they might have been planning in the future, go down the drain..... You could order it special. If enough people did so, it would be low cost. Last I checked, you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona before going there. Finally, I'm sure your state has things like small factories and machine shops. You could go into business making lights that are cheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space) and therefore _better_ than the old style... Five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy will fall apart. As if the clean air act really cleaned up the air... _MY_ *experience* seems to suggest that you're trying too hard to *educate* them (with the same methods used in American schools to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as Proto-Ugric) instead of *selling* them on the idea. ... Well, wake up. Space is becoming a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away. There are practical space projects that could conceivably (although probably not) cause lots of light pollution, and have been argued against on those grounds, even though they might open up such possibilities, that people could vacation on Mars if they wanted really dark skies...	14
Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT April 28, 1993 12:40 PM PDT Flight Sequence C9 is active as of 00:11 AM, Tuesday, April 27. With activities beginning at shortly before 5:00 AM yesterday, C9 commanded the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG (Magnetometer) Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. The spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at 9:07 AM to re-establish Inertial Reference. Transition back to Array Normal Spin began at 11:17 AM, after which the sequence powered on the on-board transmitter at 11:18 AM. Telemetry reacquisition occurred at approximately 11:30 AM at the 4 KBS Science and Engineering downlink data rate on the High Gain Antenna. Subsystem engineers report that all systems appear to be nominal. The command to terminate using the Low Gain Antenna for uplink was sent at 12:31 PM. Uplink and Downlink are currently via the HGA. MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3. Playback of DTR 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between 8:11 AM and 12:42 PM. Playback of DTR 3 is scheduled to take place tomorrow evening beginning at 11:57 PM and ending at 4:28 AM on Friday. DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second. Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks, downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate.	14
Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!! That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a break on the launcher, I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works). Only the government pays higher-than-list price. Unless you're Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line of aerospace products. If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better than buying at "list price." Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built in to the Titan? C'mon. Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this or that... Oh please. How much of a profit do you want? Pulling $100-150 million after all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby. Not to mention the other goodies I'll collect in: a) Movie & TV rights (say $100-150 million conservatively) b) Advertising ("Look Mommie, they're drinking Coke!") c) Intangibles (Name recognization, experience & data acculumated) If you want lean, fine. A $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a prize. Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider a decent profit. If you want R&D done, you'll have to write in R&D clauses. I suppose you could make it a SBIR set-aside :)	14
I didn't exactly follow the "dragless" satellitte thread. What is the point of it? are they used for laser geodesy missions? triad seemed to be some sort of navy navigation bird, but why be "dragless" why not just update orbital parameters?	14
Habital planets are also dependent on what kind of plant life can be grown.. and such.. Length of growing season (that is if you want something more than VAT food, argh, Id ratehr eat an MRE for along period of time). I know in Fairbanks (Furbanks to some) the winter can get to -60 or so F, but in the summer can get to +90 and such.. I know of worse places.. Incans and Sherpa and other low pressure atmosphere and such are a limit in human adaptability(someone mentioend that Incan woman must come to lower elevations to have babies brought to term? true?) I remember a book by Pourrnelle I think that delt with a planet was lower density air.. I wonder what the limit on the other end of atmospheres? I am limiting to human needs and stresses and not alien possibilties.. Thou aliens might be more adapted to a totally alien to human environment, such as the upper atmosphere of Jupiter or?? Almost makes bio-engineered life easy...	14
The temperature of intergalactic space (or intercluster or intersupercluster space) would be very, very close to the microwave background temperature, 2.73 kelvins. I recall that in interstellar space in our neighborhood of the galaxy it's something like 4 K. Is that what you were looking for?	14

[deleted] [deleted] Ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see those jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it? The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle makes another in the near future a non-thought. Perhaps those self same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used) and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope... --	14

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but got a message that my post might not have gone out. Considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO inalienable rights damn it! The majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out of my site. (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers. Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics. Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans. The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be. With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men. Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife. The Space Age changed all that. The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once. To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe. But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight. I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly. The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man. In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats). I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east. (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.) But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic. So I know the skies are rarely perfect. But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way. (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!) I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high. If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life. To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity. I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all. So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others. Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD	14

A young French skeptic, who reads (skeptically) the UFO review OVNI Presence (O.P.), sent me the following excerpt from an August 92 issue of this review (R.G. = Robert Galley, French minister of defense in 1974, answering about the Belgian UFO wave): "O.P. : Can you conceive that the U.S. could allow themselves to send their most modern crafts over foreign territory, with the Belgian hierarchy ignoring that ?" "R.G. : Absolutely ! The best proof which I can give is that, some time ago, without informing the French authorities, the U.S. based in Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte (*). We followed this plane, and, after its landing on the Ramstein airport, Colonel X got back the shots of Pierrelatte. The U.S. had not informed us..." (*) There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at Pierrelatte (Drome). What kind of plane could it be ? Surely not an SR-71, which our planes could not follow (and still can't)...	14

(in answer to Amruth Laxman Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that figure is about right for sustained G, no protection. The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor, either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G. A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?	14
Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort Cloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source. Besides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over geologic time, right, and needs to be replentished from somewhere else, like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt? (Or maybe I'm misremembering something I read or heard somewhere...) Until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars to detect planets, we won't know enough to say whether or not a single star has planets. And we're likely to find out about the close ones first. Heck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets. (Or was that discovery disconfirmed?)	14

Getting wierd again? Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to expensive.. Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. Kind of liek the old MIRV principle of old Cold War Days. Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missions,namely different planets. Each probe would be tied in with the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. This is good when and if we go for Mars (the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the probes. Also the mother ship would be powered (if not the Mars Mission) by a normal propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they needed.. I know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a Sail?? Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut costs.. The probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see...	14
Back in January and February there were several articles (Wash Post, Time...) saying that NASA was "considering" the option just as it is now "considering" a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission. However, the down time was estimated to be a year+ (servicing, checkout, sceheduling and training another shuttle, orbit verification...) and to be quite expensive. I think it may have been more a mental exercise than a real plan. Don't know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert Dempsey (410) 338-1334 STScI/PODPS "He which hath no stomach for this fight, Let him depart; his passport shall be made, and crowns for convoy put into his purse: We would not die in this man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us." -Shakespeare	14
Yes, but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators, not remotely black bodies. As a consequence they are a lot warmer than the "ambient". When I was in graduate school, a long time ago, we used 10,000 deg K with a DILUTION FACTOR of 10+4 for representative values of the radiant energy background in the galaxy due to starlight.	14
All consipiracy theories aside, (they are watching though :-)), will NASA try to image the Cydonia region of Mars where the "Face " is? If they can image it with the High resolution camera, it would settle the FACE question once and for all. I mean, with a camera that will have a pixel resolution of about 6 feet, we'd know whether all this stuff is real or imagination. Come on JPL and NASA folks, try to image it and settle this thing.	14
You'll find that in Allen, C.W., "Astrophysical Quantities", Athlone Press, Dover, NH, 3rd edition, pp. 268-269 (1973). To the accuracy it can be calculated (see specific references in Allen about how it is calculated), the temperature is 3 degrees K. Lots of people have remarked on this temperature. The first may have been in Eddington's book, "Internal Constitution of Stars", Ch. 13 (1926; reprinted 1986), where he gives the "temperature of space" as 3 degrees. The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight. To the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature. Some of us think this may not be a coincidence. -|Tom|-	14
I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc. I would think of the reboost as a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two JOLTS which would put more mechanical stress on the instruments. Additionally, there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing. Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination problems if the instruments came back to earth. Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch. Here's hoping Cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time.	14
I can't see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) "mothership" except for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a "Grand Tour" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt that the idea of a big "mother ship" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large "bus" spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination. The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond. The "bus" could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore. Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a relatively great distance. --- The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the "real" Voyagers, and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in addition two "sub-probes" could have been relased at Saturn, examining that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors. A small "swarm" of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of course. MARCU$	14
"The Forever War", one of my favorite SciFi books, had a passage devoted to breathing fluids. The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry-cleaning fluid saturated with oxygen. Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book. I would certainly recommend it (won the Hugo and the Nebula awards).	14

I remember a few years ago (about the time SPOT was launched), I was speaking to my Dad (an USAF officer) about this and that, and I happend to mention SPOT (I think we were talking about technology utilization). He just about went ballistic. He wanted to know how I knew about SPOT and just what I knew. I guess that space surveillance is such a sensitive topic in the Air Force that he couldn't believe that I would read about such a system in the popular press (ie. AV week). mark,	14
Let me get this right - sorry, try again. Let me get this straight - well maybe that too is a poor choice of words - someone might think I'm pushing a gay agenda. How about: let me try to understand this by re-phrasing it as an extreme. I, as a minority of one, have no right to a beautiful world. You, on the other hand have the right to make an ugly one because you presume to speak for all the rest. And I cannot complain. Curious. .. And do you want everyone to do as you wish (insist on putting something up that will impact everyone for selfish reasons) _without_ any legislation? And no one else can even object? Somehow I think this whole shoving contest has gotten way off the track. I'm ready to let this thread die a quick and merciful death.	14
Well, I'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a promise to come back with more info when I can find it. I _do_ know that BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of long-term sources. Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge of the all-sky map's accuracy. PR material for the other three instruments give accuracies on the order of "fractions of a degree", if that's any help. Speaking of GRO, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps for orbit adjust appear to be going well. Our branch guy who's helping out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the burns will take place in mid-June. Anyway, I'm off to find out more. 'Be back when I get some info.	14
I certainly like this "Option C"... It's much more like the original Phase B studies from the early 1970's. Good stuff!	14
Hans> As somebody replied on whether the space shuttle is connected to Hans> Usenet: "No. Of course the main flow of information would be up, Hans> unless Henry Spencer would be aboard, in which case the main Hans> flow of information would be down." Gene Miya says that Henry will never go aloft in the Shuttle; the payload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies. When Henry was here at Dryden, he was looking pretty covetously at the SR-71s and the F-104s, even though they don't have much cookie space. I guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....	14
I'm wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation. My dictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." I would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property. I personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft. However, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the sky and see a satellite. Many people get a real kick out of it, especially if they haven't seen one before.	14
Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope project. It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II. According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, "This second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away." Japan's 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea. All these telescopes will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes! And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics? A lot of research was done with "Star Wars" funding, and some is now being shared with astronomers. This shows great promise. Soon, probably within a few years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere. To say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is pure hokum. To use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn't matter if it gets worse is absurd. Maybe common sense and logic are the dying fields. George Krumins	14

If this man Clark is a NASA administrator then god save NASA. Of course the Shuttles record is unrivaled ! There is only one Shuttle. Furthermore, there is only likely to be one Shuttle now that Hermes and Boron are effectively cancelled. These officials should spend more of their time explaining to their European and Asian partners how we are expected to believe in them when their paymasters change their minds on major international projects everytime a new US administration takes office (considering the major impacts this has on the European and Asian (Japanese) industry). It is also appreciated how this affects American industry. I am of course talking about Space Stattion Freedom.	14
Actually, both numbers are correct. The difference is in the direction of the acceleration. For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance). In this case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit. The record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the direction you're facing" (for lack of a better term). As I recall, this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.	14
I just wanted to point out, that Teflon wasn't from the space program. It was from the WWII nuclear weapons development program. Pipes in the system for fractioning and enriching uranium had to be lined with it. Uranium Hexafloride was the chemical they turned the pitchblend into for enrichment. It is massively corrosive. Even to Stainless steels. Hence the need for a very inert substaance to line the pipes with. Teflon has all its molecular sockets bound up already, so it is very unreactive. My 2 sense worth.	14
You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost, and you don't want to clip off the panels each time. For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks, etc.) used for deployment. This was partially so that everything could be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for safety considerations. (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.) Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to orbit of $3.95 per pound :-), everybody designed things for easy servicing.	14
Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress: The Next Step The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point, many congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However, for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science, Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long record of support and interest in space development, and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act. There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns. We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon. Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring, 1993. All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office. As more is known, it will be passed on. However, even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill, this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist: either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we, by necessity, must choose. This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill. To accomplish this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson's staff review a bill. If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians. If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society).	14
I guess it's kind of an aesthetics argument. I can see the solar arrays being expensive, and there could be contingencies where you would be throwing away brand new solar cells, but it seems so cheap compared toa shuttle mission, i wouldn't think they would bother.	14
I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases. The idea behind the statement is as follows: "if you smack two neutron stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole, a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum. The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must be wrong." As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees, Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers. It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis, which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers, but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario. On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths, or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work, and therefore it *must* be so-and-so.	14

I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans. I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet. The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions. eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist from the sun and the suns temperature..) Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much can human bodies take day after day. Also how does the mass effect atmosphere. I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the earth. I suppose density should be important as well. Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc. Just the above three factors and how they relate to one another. Jonathan --	14

I'm not sure if this will help you, but the (local) interstellar radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups. If I remember things correctly, the models involved contributions from three different BB sources, so there's no obvious "temperature" of background radiation in our local area. However, the following references give the interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength, and you can integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an "effective" temperature if you like: Witt and Johnson (1973) Astrophys. J. 181, 363 - 368 Henry et al. (1980) Astrophys. J. 239, 859 - 866 Mathis et al. (1983) Astron. Astrophys. 128, 212 - 229 As you can see, the references are out of date, but they might get you started. Hope this helps,	14
Having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, I had assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function. However I always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "NO-OP" command that does something. If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a "NO-OP" command. Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion. --	14
Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career. I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of spaceflight. For several years he's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets. A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it (it's rather long). Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft... ================================== The Dream Machines: An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature By Ron Miller with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne, Florida, USA Orig. Ed. 1993 Pre-publication $84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9 This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon. The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century. The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years. As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to reach them. Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology, science, astronomy, and engineering. Once space travel became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that matter. These also are described in theis book, for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are: they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and knowledge. Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically. The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures. They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries. They reveal connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected. Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration. Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing. This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize differences, similarities, and influences. This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams. Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating. The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship. SPECIAL FEATURES Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and fictional Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos contemporary with the subject. This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA archives An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

This should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission, which achieved the highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date. And HST is now in a lower orbit. Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity.	14
(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph) Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said "Dust grains acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K." Well, I was dead wrong. Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR, which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled. Obviously, time for me to take another ISM class :-( In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday. He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon. His idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies. Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially Uranus and Neptune. A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [captured how? Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!]. He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects, 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon. Pluto/Charon, he thinks, formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth's moon. There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence for the impact theory. He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's orbit, beyond 35 AU or so. 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found, in his model. Note that such bodies will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons by now. The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms bright, new frost. So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see. I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his. By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory" to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...). He'd like to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less. His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million for 2 Proton launches. He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace. I'm just telling you what he said. Michael	14

Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ... Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time. A good reference on this might be: "Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92- 0639)." by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing. The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel. Basically, it's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane The design (the concept is also called "Beta") as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support. System design reliability is .9995. Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans. A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage. To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3. At that point the turbofans, modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets, would take over. At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions. Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225. The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin, with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would be stored aft. Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel. The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design. They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier, cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude "In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self- ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable." Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time. I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter. Does it threaten DC-???. Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government's future space transportation strategy. MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC. There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the "4-2-3" architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types, etc.) NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against the investment and risk of going to "leap frog" new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta. It's a heck of a problem. The worst part of the problem isn't that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term. They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor	14
Idea for repair of satellites: Warning I am getting creative again: Why not build a inflatable space dock. Basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure, saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it.. The inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat), thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped down own).. I know this might take a slot of work or not??? Or just to plain wierd, but ideas need to be thought of, for where is tomorrow, but in the imagination of the present..	14

This is a good question. There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable. For example, why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does? The naive answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete. Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten. What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material. On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter, mostly from oceanic sources. However, this burial requires continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered). This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere. In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere. There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment. No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified. Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it.	14

Of course, they then turn up the REverb, the Gain, add in the analog delay line and the Fuzz box. I'd think they wouldn't notice the distortion. Oh I forgot the phase shifters. Ah, but how do they compare to Mechanical systems :-)	14

Just to throw it out there: The mass of the telescope is 11,600 kg (25,500 lb). I do not know what Space lab weighs, but I believe it is less. Can anyone verify?? Also, remember that weight was not the only concern, as many others have noted, just one possible concern. I was responding to a statement that if you can boost it, why can't you land it. Those are too different problems.

I would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him. Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did definitively identify what the important questions are. I think it was Descartes who said that "All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato." If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle. This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher". Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now. They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though. As for "modern" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and amplified them over time). I would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have to be Dewey. But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect was "American", but was born in Russia). But I guess that remains to be seen.	14
Not to mention how those those liberal presidents, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush. did nothing to support true commercial space activities.	14
We can only say that they are beyond about 25 AU, due to the low accuracy of position determination by single detectors. It may be a NEW Physics problem (i.e. a problem involving new physics). However, the data is not good enough to rule out the >100 models which use old physics. New physics is a big step, and is only tolerated when there is no alternative. For example , the Dark Matter Problem (there's more to the universe than meets the eye) is a question of comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding it. Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it, but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an experimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.	14
fc> Exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big, fc> visable light telescopes? From what I've seen, 10% or less fc> (down from amlost 100% 25 years ago.) That sounds like "dying" fc> to me... That doesn't seem like a fair comparison. Infrared astronomy didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it didn't explode until IRAS in 1983. Gamma-ray (and I think X-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s. I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in general, and I know that extreme UV (short of 1000 Angstroms) observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s. Twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only had access to optical or radio instruments. Now, with far more instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of total astronomical work. fc> That would be true, if adaptive optics worked well in the visable. fc> But take a look at the papers on the subject: They refer to anything fc> up to 100 microns as "visable".

Hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using adaptive optics at the 5 m at Palomar for near-infrared observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.

If re-boosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it, then why couldn't HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done here? Is it because two shuttle flights would be required, adding to the alredy horrendous expense?

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this mission? You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence. Pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse. Slower: The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December. That's less than eight months away. There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain and reschedule the EVA's in that time. More Expensive: Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS. In addition, you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware. According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and AXAF. Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle, there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.	14
I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds). (And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way back when it was only on sci.space). For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the part of proponents. Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the target area. You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites. I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types. #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested recently. While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned, and something any project like that would work against anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find many activists in Murmansk demanding the "natural" sky back. If anything, he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp, making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the "day." The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't have lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be able to convince them to stop.	14
-jeremy Are you talking about a single BATSE component, or the whole thing? You *could* propose a BATSE probe; launch two or three with ion drive on various planetary trajectories... your resolution increaces the more they're spaced apart. You could probably cheaply eject them from the solar system with enough flybys and patience. Things would start out slow, then slowly get better and better resolution...	14
We don't disagree on this. All I said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce. The Bill of Rights didn't come into effect until it was ratified by the states (and indirectly, the people); from that point it defined legal rights. "Common law" rights are vague and situational; that's why the people insisted on a Bill of Rights in the Constitution, spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government. Legitimate or illegitimate, power is power. That's why the federal government can force states to grant their citizens rights they don't wish to: In a slugging match, the feds win. Period. And you're right, this doesn't belong in sci.space. I've said my peace. No more frome me on rights (at least not here).	14
There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena. However, there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network. To be precise, there is no particular plan, period. This is a large part of the problem. In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time. The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini. It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for). The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion. Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth. The few things that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is *not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.	14
Or perhaps even weird? Hmmm, you might want to read this group more carefully; there's been a good amount of discussion of the proposed Pluto Fast Flyby (PFF) mission that is specifically designed to be small and cheap.	14

I'll vote for anything where they don't feel constrained to use stupid and ugly PC phrases to replace words like 'manned'. If they think they need to do that, they're more than likely engaging in 'politics and public relations as usual' rather than seriously wanting to actually get into space. So that eliminates Option "A" from the running. What do they call a manned station in Option "C"? [I'm actually about half serious about that. People should be more concerned with grammatical correctness and actually getting a working station than they are with 'Political Correctness' of terminology.] -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	14
Ken: Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big Boys if you're tackling Henry. Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs, too. Good luck, son. Ahem. The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be Politically Correct to contend so. It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle. Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals. The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come, to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs. There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost. Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash. As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-: DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental "X-plane" hardware. It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks. I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or building the DC-Y. I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics. I don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else. If the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space. The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a prospect too depressing to bear. (Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction. It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks. It's creating its own market for small payloads.) I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some of them as good as or better than SSTO. There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line. [...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...] Strawman. Is anybody seriously proposing this? References, please. The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations, as well as the "bird in the hand" argument your common sense tells you. If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the Shuttle, not instead of it. Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated. If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M, rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites instead of one. Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series. Little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of begging a ride. This is just supply and demand. You should be able to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a big difference in costs. Do you have some reason to think not?	14

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment. Ran forward, it would suck energy from the Earth's magnetic field, while trivially slowing the Shuttle. It could also have run backward -- if they ran electricity through the tether the other way, it would have trivially propelled the Shuttle faster. But an even better example comes to mind. There's this electronics guy, someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster. Ten years ago he wrote about an invention of his. He could take a light-detector, run current through it at about a hundred times its rating, and it would glow. He got legal rights to this design of a combination "fiber optic emitter/receiver". This turned out to be the basic unit of ATT's (I think) plan to bring Brazil's communications system into the 21st century. (The article was mostly about his legal wranglings with the company that eventually got him well-compensated for his invention.)	14
Hmm... there must be two towns with the same name. Kaliningrad, located just North of Moscow is correct. It is the home of several Russian space enterprises, including NPO Energia, Krunichev, Fakel, and Tsniimach. The main Russian manned spacecraft control facility is also located here. Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours can be arranged. Call ahead though, there are still armed military guards at many of these facilities -- who don't speak English, aren't well paid, and are rather bored. It's a very popular destination with Western space industry types at the moment. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor	14
Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT April 30, 1993 11:30 AM PDT DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29) at approximately 6:00 AM. Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before. Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning. After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed. These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday, 4/29/93. Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection. However, the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days. As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode. The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.	14
This presupposes that no supersonic ramjet aircraft/spacecraft can be reliable or low-cost. This is unproven.	14

For example, is : >there a constant sensation of falling? Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied: : Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling. It may feel strange at first, : but the body does adjust. The feeling is not too different from that : of sky diving. I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times. I'll tell you about my first flight. At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine straightened. I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my involuntary motions. My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while you have a cold). At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, since I had some science to do. I was busy keeping my experiment going and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay attention to physiology at that time. After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, concious motion for my experiment. During the pull-out to parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I had to use one of those air-sickness bags. I was basically useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous people who don't get sick on the thing.) I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so much as like swimming in air. It's very close to the sensations I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up. Jerry: : >And what is the motion sickness : >that some astronauts occasionally experience? Ron: : It is the body's reaction to a strange environment. It appears to be : induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. : Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more : prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do, among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions. I was in one called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual aids. The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness symptoms.

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies. The "large" grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency. However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating efficiency is poor. (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths.) Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed. Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns. Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them. In the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation. Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of "small" grains. These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K. Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K. Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed "average" temperature. A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components. These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K). At the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5. The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane. To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then take the fourth root. In the table below, starlight comes from Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75. No doubt careful work could do much better. (The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong. We would be cooked if that were the case. In any event, the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background, and I believe that to be correct.) Dilution Temp. DT^4 Microwave background 1 2.7 53 Galactic dust 2E-5 25 8 Zodiacal dust (emission) 6E-8 280 369 Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13 5500 275 Starlight 1E-13 5500 92 ----- 797 The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K. Outside the Solar system, the result would be 3.5 K. I find these results surprising, especially the importance of Zodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes.	14

Davis Nicoll sez; I'd buy that for two reasons. The tubes for TV's and radios (if you can still find them) are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors. Also, ask any electric-guitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer, and they'll tell you tube-type, since tubes have lower distortion and noise than transistors. 'Course, most of your electric guitar types just say "Tubes sound better, dude." :-) Also, transistors have the advantage in both waste-heat and energy-use, mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes. -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk \\ As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.	14
I'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it might be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base. Reentry would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge forces to both the mirror and mount. It could be that one or both of these would not survive. greg --	14

We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform. This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS (Small Expendable Deployment System), which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico. This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered. We want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible. We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute. An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs (Search and Rescue Satellites). It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking. These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon). They are rugged (they have to be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap. We have several questions: 1. What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons. Are there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian? 2. What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals. Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies? 3. What is the coverage of SARSATS? Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous orbit? 4. Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders?

For some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control everything.

Hello netters, I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place for my post. I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games. In the movies, the CIA utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa. The photos taken by the sats are stunning! I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles. My question is this: The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS. And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA. The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat. The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type. That is, one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp. Does such techology exist and what is it's nature? i.e., UV, IR, x-ray, etc. PS Who wrote the book Patriot Games?	14
Well, you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle. and most ELV's have too far of a backlog for political messages.

You'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic (but closer than 9 Mpc). I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think of how to get many gammas out. Maybe I should look it up. Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*. That's just in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but "bursts"? Nah. Neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show that those energies *are* produced by things we know about.	14
Hello, All! I apologize, I haven't published my astro FTP list since March. Now I haven't tested all the sites included into the list. I would notified all the people, you have stored some older issues of my, there are now lots of changes. Many sites have gone away: They either do not exist any more or all the astro stuff have removed. The job keep this list is very hard, so all the notes and informat- ion of changes, new sites, new contents etc. is welcome. I would thank all the net people who give me information for the newest version. regards, Veikko Makela	14
.. As Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here. Do you know something we don't? Please supply a source - it would be nice for the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to be. These altitude numbers are also way off. My best source has: "Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is: 573 Kilometers" "Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is: 603 Kilometers" "Delta ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is: 3 Kilometers" (PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.) .. Could you supply some calculations? You might check some recent postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does not now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible. The contamination threat also remains. .. Longer drag life I can understand, but could you explain the antenna pointing? Tell me about it. Although the arrays can be (and are) moved perfectly well utilizing the second electronics box. Getting them both working is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy. I don't mean to jump on you - helpful suggestions are always welcome and we all know the more ideas the better, but I do want the true situation to be described clearly and correctly, lest some get confused.	14
Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones. Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway. Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious limitation. I sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent and as bright as the moon. Have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night? Existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that appeared as a point would be useless, so I rather think these will appear larger than a 'typical' satellite. Also, satellite tracks *are* ruining lots of plates in the current Palomar Sky Survey. What deparment are you in anyway, Philosophy? You obviously are not qualified to speak about astronomy...	14

No, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone. Ownership is necessary to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the action was good or bad. If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I can't unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't have the authority to declare that it is wrong. The owner may find it artistic or she may be call the police. (this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights) It's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. "maliciously" implies evil intent. The lighting companies aren't going out of their way to spoil the sky. They just don't care. It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware. If that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell. Write a letter to city hall. Please note that I'm not defending light pollution. The orignial focus of this thread was space based light sources.	14
I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is inherently a good thing. Most people today only care about "what will it cost me?" and "what's in it for me?" and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself. Our society has become increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!). They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century. They want something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*. I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program. That is the only way you can *prove* its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too. The continued existence of the space program relies upon that money. just my $.02 BTW: don't forget Velcro...	14
Wm Hathaway comments; I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not. You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision. You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least, our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts that others call ugly. One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all of the heavens, with no lights. If advertising in space can help us reach that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally unreachable. One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, just because it has changed the way we strive. BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled. Sometimes they make it better. -Tommy Mac ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk \\ As the radius of vision increases, 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.	14
HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg). That doesn't include the cradle that would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed. Spacelab-J on STS-47 was 21,861 lbs (according to the press-kit). As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this was a planned for contingency. This is not a problem for the shuttle, though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site, they still have to go to Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay. --GaryM	14
How big of a lightning rod, would you need for protection? and would you need jupiter as a ground plane.	14
I don't know what you mean by 'edged', but surely there are two other possibilities for an isotropic distribution: near interstellar (up to ~100 pc, i.e. within the disc), or the Galaxy's corona?	14
This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement. In particular, are you referring to the native American culture that existed in 1400, or the one that existed in 1800? (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about the eastern US rather than the whole continent.) Given that those were *radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to? Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi, did all of these things. (Well, maybe not "on Sunday", but they did have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.) If you are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed in 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition to find out what pre-Columbian native American culture, at least in the more civilized parts of the continent, was like.	14
> > What evidence indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away? > >Given the enormous power, i was just wondering, what if they are > >quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by? > >Why would they have to be at galactic ranges? . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic, 'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or part of the Oort cloud. Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there isn't a mechanism for the others either. What on Earth is the "gravisphere"? Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances. In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin. _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at least it was a good try...	14
Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable. if the shuttle is going to retunr the HST, what bother are some arrays. just fit them with a quick release. one space walk, or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays.	14
I didn't think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as for the ability to launch in a tight (size) STS envelope. This is my own guess, based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c (GRO, UARS). Also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional S/A). Finally, the HST arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're going to be replaced with new arrays. However, as an ACS guy who's seen his branch management pull their collective hair out over HST, I would voice a hearty 'yea' to using conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible. No half hertz flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.	14
I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they would have HAD to land with HST in the bay. Indeed they were worried about that. One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag. I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months. In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do. I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment. You would have the horrendous cost of transporting, cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time. And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out. Better to have two servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down and take it up again.	14

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration, sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major headache. We're talking seriously high cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels. Incidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration system for something like this. They don't go anywhere quickly. (I speak as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.) They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first.	14
[Space ad proposed] This is undoubtedly the sickest thing to come down the marketing pipe in years, and the best reason for resurrecting the "Star Wars" killer satellite system.	14
Hi Folks, Last year America bought two "Hall Generators" which are used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSR,if I could recall correctly these devices were sent to JPL,Pasadena labs for testing and evaluation. I am just curious to know how these devices work and what what principle is involved .what became of them.There was also some controversy that the Russian actually cheated,sold inferior devices and not the one they use in there space vehicles. Any info will be appreciated... ok { Thank{ in advance... Tamoor A Zaidi Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Norton AFB,San Bernardino	14
I think you've got an off-by-one error in your memory. :-) MM bought the satellite-building side of GE. E, not D. MM and GD are still competitors. Better, yes, but we're not talking order of magnitude. (Especially if you want to use Titan IV, which belongs to the USAF, not MM.) Sure, you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately rather than as a gummint project. But we're still talking about something that will cost nine digits per launch, unless you can guarantee a large market to justify volume production.	14

It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business. For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not. The 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port. The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities. The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project. Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch, don't think that nothing has happened. From my interactions with the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm, believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar. I believe that all will happen this summer and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur. Stephen Horan shoran@nmsu.edu	14
:>... Also, as implied by other posters, why :>do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway? ... :You don't *need* to, but it's desirable. HST, like all satellites in :low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag. It was :deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason. :It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter. (It has :no propulsion system of its own.) Has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the HST yet? Give it a push? I can see the push start cartoons now :-).	14

One of the main reasons nations like the US and RUSSIA observe satellite that have been launched is FORBs system whick loft nuclear bombs into orbit which are planned to be detonated in LEO causing EMP pulses interfering with the target command and control system.	14
People who criticize "big Government" and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology. Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term. (Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries. In order for U.S. industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.) As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way. I believe that market forces should drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it. But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not. So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does. (This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations, doesn't it?) But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness. The general idea is to spend money on new technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture, despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology. And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little sense to try to save money. Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be. It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects. GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors. The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large construction project now uses these tools. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368	14
Does anyone have a reference (something I can look up, not just your own recollections -- I have a few of those myself) on the temperature of the (night) sky as seen from space? Note, I am *not* talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background Radiation. There are more things in the sky than just the MBR; what I'm after is total blackbody temperature -- what a thermal radiator would see, disregarding (or shielding against) the Sun and nearby large warm objects. My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially higher than that of the MBR, once you figure in things like stars and the zodiacal light, but I'd like numbers.	14
Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body. Morgan&Gordon's fat "Communications Satellite Handbook" has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength, in fact, for communications design. However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible. For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, "Astrophysical Quantities"). I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says "about 4K" in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.	14
It's public because it belongs to everybody. It's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. If they can sell you or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent of its light, they make more _money_. Never mind that your money is wasted. Never mind that taxpaper's money is wasted. Never mind that the sky is ruined. Bob Bunge	14
It's not quite what you were asking, but a few years ago I helped some EE remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of ice; they used the sky for a background calibration source. They said that from Earth's surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody.	14
Right? What right? And don't you mean something more like: It so typical that the wants of the minority can obstruct the wants of the majority, no matter how ridiculous those minority wants might be or what benefits those majority wants might have? [My sole connection with the project is that I spent a lot of time in classes at the University of Colorado.] -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	14
Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more propulsion capability than we can manage. You would have to boost to Pluto and then slow back down. You could do something like a Hohman orbit, but I think that would take ridiculous amounts of time (my Rubber Bible is at home). -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	14
they weren't even carrying extra suits. So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS? That's the critical question. My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant. Of that, a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry burn and the reserve. So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going mass. If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested. After you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra equipment is going to cost. First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was because they _had_ to. They don't like to do that as a general rule. Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6? They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that. Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely. Third, they don't have eight months. They have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved. You may think I have a pessimistic attitude. I think it's realistic. I'm not saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are). What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA management. "All they have to do is soup it up?" Just what does that mean? The second servicing mission is a contingency. You have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan. No, Pat, I haven't forgotten. No Pat. That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement costs, minus extra operating costs. TANSTAAFL. I'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious. Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to perform this task, it also ignores the point. There is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done about it. Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door, you haven't solved the problem.	14
I like this statement, though for my own reasons. Cost comparisons depend a lot on whether the two options are similar, and *then* it becomes very revealing to consider what their differences are. Can Soyuz launch the Long Exposure Facility? Course not. Will the Shuttle take my television relay to LEO by year's end? Almost certainly not, but the Russians are pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule. Comparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space launcher-and-work-platform resources, with similarities and differences. Where they are in direct competition, we may get to see some market economics come into play. tombaker	14
No, no, no! The previous one was called "Smiley". 1992 QB1 = Smiley, and 1993 FW = Karla. Note that neither name is official. It seems the discoverers have an aversion to the designation scheme.	14
I understand the when one is in orbit, the inward force of gravity at one's center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal force from the orbiting motion, resulting in weightlessness. I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like. For example, is there a constant sensation of falling? And what is the motion sickness that some astronauts occasionally experience? Please reply only if you are either a former or current astronaut, or someone who has had this discussion first-hand with an astronaut. Thanks!	14
In Space Digest V16 #487, ...about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit, Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy. In short, an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on the Earth is trash. Billboards make a place look trashy. That is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use. The light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky. Regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer can somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash.	14
Even if they did, a globe at a scale that you could fit into your average room or even average "hall" the deviations you mention would not be visually evident.

Well pat for once I agree with you and I like your first idea that you had. IT probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar spacecraft! :) Well it makes as much sense as some things. I was at the first Gamma Ray Burst conference here at UAH and had great fun watching the discomfiture of many of the Gamma Ray scientists. Much scruitiny was given to the data reductions. I remember one person in particular who passionately declared that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the warp transition theory :(. The next conference is soon and I will endeavour to keep in touch with this fun subject.	14
My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988. There seem to have been a total of seven before that. I seem to recall that someone, either ASI or the University of Rome (?) includes money in their annual budget for maintainance of the platforms (there are actually two). The Italians have been spending money to develop an advanced Scout. However, recent events in the Italian space program, and the Italian government overall make me skeptical that this will get off the ground in the near future.	14
I'd guess this was a garbled report of the NERVA effort to develop a solid-core fission rocket (the most mundane type of nuclear rocket). That was the only advanced-propulsion project that was done on a large enough scale to be likely to attract news attention. It *could* be any number of things -- the description given is awfully vague -- but I'd put a small bet on NERVA.	14
The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not (yet) supported by any Macintosh display software that I know of. However, there does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that is recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIH/Image. It is called "PDS Decompress" and is available via anonymous ftp from the "pub" directory on "delcano.mit.edu" [18.75.0.80]. This is a Binhex/ Stuffit archive and contains the application itself, Think-C source, and a very brief description. The most recent version of NIH/Image (1.48) may be down-loaded from "starhawk.jpl.nasa.gov", where it is located in "image148.hqx" in the "pub" directory. This archive also contains source code, but not the documentation, which is located in the "image1455.hqx" archive in the same directory.	14
You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network. Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time of arrival. With three detectors properly arranged, one can often get positions down to ~arc minutes. BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future? Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1 ms). We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution. For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the order of 16 light years. I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction.	14
There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask: 1) If we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it? 2) If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will we expend resources from earth to help them? 3) With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable, what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere? -- Have a day,	14

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at least it was a good try... So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-) Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow. We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models. Hmm, the "superbowl" burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read (and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service. To get a copy of this Here is the abstract of that paper. ... indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list, although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved. This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no, anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference. That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...	14
Why don't you activist guys cut misc.invest out of this thread? They didn't offer any shares for sale yet...	14
Another factor against bringing the HST back to Earth is risk of contamination.	14
Uh, no. These burst detectors are just that, burst detectors. They have no angular resolution. Now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution, but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort cloud or not. We have one network, and trying to make two networks out of it degrades what angular resolution we have.	14
_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at least it was a good try... So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow. We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models. A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service. To get a copy of this paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject line get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper. The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them at cosmological distances; but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list, although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved. We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE catalogue up to March, 1992), and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams (1992) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia, assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect, at least to some extent, true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$ test to both distributions.	14

It would be nice if someone here from the HST program was talking instead of all the speculation that is going on here. From what I understand from Dr. Frank Six of the Marshall Space Flight Center there is no insrmountable problem in bringing HST back. IT was designed that way to begin with. Also it is my understanding that the solar arrays WILL be one of the items replaced on this mission. The originals were built by Brit Aerospace and I think the new ones are too. I am currently working with the guys at MSFC that are in charge is the HST power system, although I have not spoken with them in a long time about HST.	14
Actually, the situation is even worse than that. The *total mass* of the Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds, and most of that is support equipment like power and communications. The mass available for instruments is maybe 10% of that. I don't think a BATSE will fit... Actually, would you need the shielding? My understanding is that it's mostly there to give the detectors some directionality. No point in doing that if you've only got one. I'm sure the burst detectors that have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much. (Mind you, they're probably still too heavy -- the PFF people would put more Pluto-specific instruments on first, if they had any mass to spare.)	14
The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some incredible results! There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin. Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software. It works realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble. You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System. Starting on page 52 of the April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product. It lists for $1,290. The article states: "The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around." Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope's focal plane." Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its development.

Apologies... Your mail is probably in the pile that arrived just before I got sick about a month ago... A reply will appear eventually... So far, there have been none (unless you count an interview in The Amateur Computerist about the history of netnews, which may be disqualified because TAC's budget doesn't run to reproducing photos...).	14
"Let's make a deal!" If you're going to put up a billion, I'd want to budget the whole sheebang for $450-600 million. If I have that much money to throw around in the first place, you betcha I'm going to sign a contract committing to volume production...	14
Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for the mother ship that can't be applied to the probes. Otherwise it's better to simply launch the probes independently. The outer planets are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one. Uranus is *not* on the way to Neptune. Don't judge interplanetary trajectories in general by what the Voyagers did: they exploited a lineup that occurs only every couple of centuries, and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect route to Neptune. Solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system. They're also very slow, unless you assume quite advanced versions.	14
Someone named Hansk asked about pictures. Well, there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at ftp.uu.net. Henry Spencer's picture is there somewhere, along with several thousand others. I don't remember the path, though it should be easy to find. Remember, though, it seems to use both internet and uucp addresses.	14
A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise. The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller. A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky. The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we have observed 17 satellite launches. Leo Wikholm	14
Or how about: "End light pollution now!!" Your banner would have no effect on its subject, but my banner would.	14
Using greenhouses to extend the growing season shouldn't be a problem. I'm supprised they don't do so in Alaska (cheaper to import, perhaps?) No, the Incas had no problems with this, but the Spanish did.	14
You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-) However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago. ( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see ) I suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration, but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.	14
Climbers regard 8000 metres and up as "The Death Zone". Even on 100% Oxygen, you are slowly dying. At 8848m (Everest), most climbers spend only a short period of time before descending. I've been above 8000 once. Descending as little as 300m feels like walking into a jungle, the air is so thick. Everest in winter without oxygen, no support party (Alpine style). That is the "ultimate challenge" (or is it solo?)	14

Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle : bring them down to use as spares? One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization burn(s). On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G. This means that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else. Dead weight has a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages. Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not- quite-man-ratable. But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch failure is too high. -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368	14

Well, I seem to have struck an interesting discussion off. Given that I am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist, i'll have to boil it down a bit. 1) ALl the data on bursts to date, shows a smooth random distribution. 2) that means they aren't concentrated in galactic cores, our or someone elses. 3) If the distribution is smooth, we are either seeing some ENORMOUSLY large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena OR we are seeing some phenomena out at like the Oort cloud, but then it needs some potent little energy source, that isn't detectable by any other current methods. 4) we know it's not real close, like slightly extra solar, because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts. 5) the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like that. So everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile. what i am wondering, is this in people's opinion, A NEW Physics problem. Einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect. Copernicus, started looking at irregularities in planetary motion. Is this a big enough problem, to create a new area of physics? just a little speculative thinking folks.	14

Although the $1 billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space business called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a much smaller program ($65 million) will pass the 103rd Congress. This is the Back to the Moon bill, put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act. The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding. There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $65 million. Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $65 million program, as the Delta Clipper program has shown (DC-X was funded by SDIO at $59 million). We have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true. Please support the Back to the Moon bill.

I do not understand what you are saying here. What is improved, what is Significant, and what does this have to do with carrying more equipment on a servicing mission? Also, as implied by other posters, why do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway? Maybe you have something here, but could you please clarify it for us on the net? From what I've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix. The motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware. I expect to be corrected if I'm wrong on this.	14
The other week I saw a TV program about the american space industry and NASA. It said that in the 60's they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear particles for propolsion. The government however, didn't give them $1billion for the developement of a full scale rocket. Did anybody see this program? If not, has anybody heard of the particle propolsion system? Thanx. 8-)	14

The "artist renderings" that I've seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding HST at a ~30 degree angle to the Shuttle. I think the rendering was conceived before the array replacemnet was approved, so I'm not sure if the current reboost will occur with the arrays deployed or not. However, it doesn't appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost. Thanks for the input on GRO's S/A design constraints. That would explain the similar design on UARS. Heck, the MMS project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind. The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement for the instrument module on EUVE. That way, you get two instruments for the price of one spacecraft bus (the Explorer Platform). A second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the FUSE telescope.	14
I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information. What these people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today. It is called labview by National Instruments. IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language. IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes. IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent. This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability. Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today. The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW. There are tons of applications, with the ability to create "virtual" instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires. With the addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station, allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial I/O support that instrument can be anywhere. The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.	14
Much of Cook's later exploration was privately funded, by Joseph Banks among others (eg in Resolution & the earlier Endeavour). Colnett's voyage to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of British whaling vessels. Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy. The list is almost endless. Those doing the funding were about eighty percent motivated by potential profit, ten percent by potential glory and ten percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.	14
That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures. For instance, a power company in Virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type. Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light. Thus, you couldn't even buy a good light from them. In most places, to get a good light, you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona. At some point, society starts to make rules. Cars have to pass safety tests. Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc.. There are two ways to achieve this: educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs. History seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work. Agreed, so I won't respond again. It's important for all you spacers out there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that have been presented. Just like Congress, it would be best to consult the astronomers/lovers of the night sky before you try some PR stunt to boost public knowledge about space.	14

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS PART 3 Copyright (c) 1993 by Larry Klaes The author gives permission to any group or individual wishing to distribute this article, so long as proper credit is given, the author is notified, and the article is reproduced in its entirety. To the North Pole! On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan Republic. Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe for the planet Venus. Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit. To accomplish this task, the basic VENERA design was modified in numerous areas. The central bus core was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier. Extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging. The dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to Earth. Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound) POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae. The radar system, possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus' surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter. And while the VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of Venus. This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation. On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours. VENERA 16 followed suit four days later. The twin probes thus became Venus' first polar-circling spacecraft. Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 for VENERA 16. For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long. The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large Soviet antennae on Earth. Each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer. By the end of their main missions in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet. VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s. Numerous hills, mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years. In planetary terms this makes the Venerean surface rather young. Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere. There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features. For example, the probes' owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact. American scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra. In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later in the decade. Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig- nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM). Eventually the machine would be called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan (circa 1480-1521). This vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the VENERAs. For the time, however, the Soviet probes maintained that distinction. Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs. Bolted next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's temperatures. The majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating current volcanic activity. The probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) lower than at the equator. In contrast, the polar air above sixty kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights. When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes. Unfortunately this idea did not come to pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control gas to perform the operation. VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus. Venus by Balloon For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of air with balloon-borne instruments. Professor Jacques Blamont of the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982. Nevertheless, late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true. When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe since 1975. This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission. The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei being the Russian word for Halley. Not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley. This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910. Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to Earth. Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system. Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter. The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of Halley. The ESA would be using the cylindrical GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines. However, government budget cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts. The U.S. would have to make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984. The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs. Instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced Venus mission along the way. As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus, the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986. As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985. VEGA 1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander making a two-day descent towards the planet. The craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11. Sixty-one kilometers (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles) altitude. Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had successfully arrived. One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet). Dangling on a tether thirteen meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as an aerostat. The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon. Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics, and instruments. Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles. The aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet's atmosphere. The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just north of the equator. Scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data. This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions. The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover. The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600 kilometers (6,960 miles). The threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize. The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978. Indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers (150 miles) per hour. Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the journey. The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere. The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already headed towards the Venerean surface. Both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 and 14 in 1982. However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra. While still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 miles) above the surface. There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing. This was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never before been directly examined. Nevertheless, the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 56 minutes of ground transmissions. A large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site. As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and 12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere. The French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, and possibly phosphorus. It is the sulfur - possibly from active volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color. The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles) contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid. The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS. The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results nearly matched its twin. The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes. The layers were three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles). The clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), much lower than the PV readings. One possibility for the discrepan- cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air over the last seven years. When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley. On March 6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space. The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel. On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for a two-day fall towards Venus. Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2 balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet. During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile) flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission. After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours. When the balloon passed over a five- kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) towards the surface. Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1 balloon. This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed through the balloon's level. No positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer failed to function. The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) southeast of VEGA 1. The lander's resting place was smoother than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava. The soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands. This rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium. A high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil. The air around VEGA 2 measured 463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres, essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus. Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 kilometers (4,818 miles). Both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three hours. Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects. One prime target was the near- Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles). Sadly, the Soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned. VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987. Future Plans Diverted The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the Sun. One example was the VESTA mission, planned for the early 1990s. This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992. The craft would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes. The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over the VEGA balloons' two days. The mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main Belt planetoid as seen from Earth. Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in the Soviet Union. In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact. By this time in the Soviet space program interest was focusing on Mars. Already under construction was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS. Two members of this class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next year. PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on Mars' largest moon, Phobos. All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions, including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century. The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future. But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars exploration. Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions, one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in March of 1989. In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in 1998. Several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put on indefinite hold. No other official Soviet missions to Venus have since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet. During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the Soviet Union. President Mikhail Gorbachev began to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West. While the culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market". These effects hit everywhere, including the space program. Missions at all levels were cut back. The Soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money. In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary probe. No nation took them up on the bargain. Meanwhile the United States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own. MAGELLAN and GALILEO The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989. Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history. When MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16. In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit the giant planet Jupiter in 1995. On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the probe's primary target's major moons in 1610. In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach Jupiter. As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary goal in February of 1990. The probe radioed back images of the planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere. On the Drawing Boards With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years, new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus. Scien- tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, 1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions within in the next decade. Japan, India, and the ESA have also considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades. In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system. For Venus two missions were selected for further study: A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967. Final project decisions will be made in 1994. Humans on Venus Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus? At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something even tougher than a VENERA lander. Plans have been looked into changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like Earth's. However, it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every 243 Earth days. Such a project may take centuries if not millennia. In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand Venus as its exists today. We still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place. Will Earth ever suffer this fate? Perhaps Venus holds the answers. Such answers may best be found through international cooperation, including the nation which made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus. Bibliography - Barsukov, V.

[deleted] Not to flame (REALLY), but thats an abominable viewpoint (while were on the subject of abominations). If we followed the "redistiribution of wealth" (and by the way, ist that what Clinto and the Democrats are trying to do...), EVERYONE would starve in short order. Not only is it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every (wo)man's altruism (can you say black market under communisim anyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely energy dependant. There are not enough sources of cheap capital (aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an excellent source of materials and realestate. More directly, perhaps you mioght consider the fact that BILLIONS are spent by TV companies, and their sponsors, (ABC, NBC, CBS...) on the SUPERBOWL, the OLYMPICS, and even on monday night baseball games. Perhaps we should boycott those games? If DC-X and company get finished, and there is a market for it, those "abominable" space will probably be much more cost effective for the companies, and those starving children. More people buy products, the company hires more workers, end result fewer children die of starvation. --	14
Astronomy & Space magazine's UK telephone newsline carries the times to see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING (some time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from April 27 to May 7. It's about as bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board. For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a few pence). E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon. With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir! -Tony Ryan, "Astronomy & Space", new International magazine, available from: Astronomy Ireland, P.O.Box 2888, Dublin 1, Ireland. 6 issues (one year sub.): UK 10.00 pounds, US$20 surface (add US$8 airmail).

[...] This reminds me... my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking of reviving the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya, where the Copernicus satellite was launched around 1972. Is this true, or am I imagining it? Possibly it's connected with one of the Italian programs to revive the Scout in a new version. That old platform must be getting pretty rusty, and there ain't a lot of infrastructure to go with it...	14

I can't speak to sheer mass, but part of the problem is that HST wasn't built to ever be brought back down. It's not built for those kinds of 'jolt' forces and there is no support cradle for it (which is additional weight that would be required. -- "Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world." -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden	14
Pennicillin if i have everything correct, was a highly valuable Myco-toxin, discovered during WW2. It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity. It's immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal. Although initially enormously expensive to culture, within 3 years, the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude, and within 10 years, was not much more expensive then aspirin. Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections. Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval. It promised amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease. It consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement, However it works less then 1 in 5 times of administration and costs $2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost. The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case, and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients. I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin, but to centoxin.	14

If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense. The question is whether anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing. You'd almost certainly use air. Given that you have to pressurize with *something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable (even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing, to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere is breathable in a pinch -- it makes mask functioning much less critical).	14

I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts, description, and functionality for just about any IC made. Does such a text exist? Are there docs on the Internet that reference IC's? It would be a great idea if each major IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files. (ala RFC style). This would save time and money for the IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send around the world via internet and since most users of IC's are found in the internet anyway. Are there any books available for purchase that reference (as many as possible)? Or am I going to be stuck obtaining a zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little phonebook-type books that are obsoleted every couple years)	12
Jeez, that should do it. Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate distances ... might be more interesting than my application. Just a thought, you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse. A Hamamatsu detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give the current position. Store and collate this on a computer and you could replay the movements on the screen. Interesting! --	12

Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes: 1) A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the tape. The message usually reads, "If seal is broken, you must buy this tape" 2) The standard "MacroVision" warning, "Copies of this tape will be unviewable" 3) [your case] Extended message for the Average Consumer (tm) which states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the original. I don't believe you can sue them for misinformation in cases like this :-) Take care. P.S. Of course, #3 is utter BS - but the Average Consumer (tm) believes it. Heck, my mom once returned such a tape without watching it... she was afraid that something might just happen :-)	12
The simplest and cheapest soft UV bulb is an AR-1 argon bulb (or other argon bulb). It works like a neon bulb except it glows purple. It will cause stuff to fluoresce. It requires very little power, just a battery, an oscillator, and a step-up transformer to about 100 volts.	12

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point. I have yet to chose a tracking method. The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage. I did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition. And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes away. The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body. This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture. Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.	12
Could someone point me toward a source (FTP/BBS/whatever) for development tools for the 8051 microprocessor. I specifically am looking for a Macintosh cross-assembler/disassembler. Also, is there a mailing-list dedicated to discussing the 8051? Thanks.	12
WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the error of 1% to cope with. You have 3 choices; a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low sensitivity designs b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale) c) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)	12
Radio Shack stores sell them here in the States. Not sure if InterTan is carrying these for Australia or not... Cost is $6 USD. You charge them under a fluorescent, then they glow when exposed to IR.	12

To put it bluntly, they are full of it. Paying a tape is playing a tape. There is no difference whether the output goes to a second VCR or to a TV. (How the VCR or TV reacts to this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision copy protection.) In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry of its own within the tape case. The circuit would have to somehow magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to. The circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything. It is a pretty lame scare tactic. (I've seen something similar on a BBS. When the SYSOP wanted to, he could have a message sent to the user's end saying that it is sending the code to format your HD.)	12

Hi folks, I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the original. I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different processes. However, I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't want to take the chance even it's small. Anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes? Thanks in advance.	12

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one in the center has the grayish board exposed. On the left is some fiberglass board that looks green to me. I see no reason for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-). I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their low noise microwave preamps? Often, microwave circuits have odd bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?). A solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits. (Q dope for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with minimal loss).

Yes, but still not a 6502 for those differences. Same instruction set, of course. Yes, the same number, but an entirely different device. I should have qualified this further by stating that this was the PAL version of the TIA - I am not 100% sure that the NTSC TIA would have a different number. Does anyone on the net actually have details of the TIA, as this is the only device I have not yet discovered details about? Atari Australia, when asked, claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600 had failed, as the US head office had refused to provide it. I saw a couple of cheaper devices with PN2222's and a couple of resistors hooked up as a cheap inverter. Nasty, but workable, and cheaper than a 7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.	12

I know exactly which two bytes need to be changed, I have the code to do them too. I just said "Don't ask me which ones." I didn't say I don't know what that means. Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which does a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match value stored (encrypted, of course) in the program. It could be claimed as a part of anti-virus code, and it would not be far from the truth. a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup above. Did ANYONE read what I wrote? That is NOT what I wrote! (or meant!) What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the manufacturer. The manufacturer will then supply the then-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the "Registered to XXX" screen. Of course they will, but that was NOT my point. The purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates ("Oh, can I have a copy of that?"/"Sure, here.") and the less sophisticated pirates ("Let's look for all those calls to INT13H...") . Any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed. They can always backtrace the entire load-sequence of the program. The point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses (or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use. Pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy protection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped. How many of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us? Not that many.	12

The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold. The temperature combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of the battery. I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite cooler.	12
I'm working on an audio mixer project, but I'm having trouble finding parts. I want to use op-amps for the gain control stages. The ones I have found that are good for audio are LM739 and LM833, but I cannot find either of these in the electronic parts places I've looked. Are there any good substitute op-amps and/or are there any parts suppliers in the LA area that carry this kind of thing (10KOhm dual audio taper slider pots would be nice, too). Any info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.	12
I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't copy the program if "diskcopy" can't do it. If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will suffice. I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not* because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find. Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk, so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend" out the backups. No flames intended - just my thoughts.	12
I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection. As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a CD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made. Hmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You would need a tonne of disks though.	12
The 200CD is one of three oscillators that HP made many years ago. (The others were the Low Frequency Oscillator and the Wide Range Oscillator.) These are the ones with the 7" diameter chrome dial, a Wein Bridge circuit that used pilot lights as the feedback loop, and firebottles that produced many volts of output. I've just acquired a pair of these venerable old beasts. The non-working one, SN 605, (owned by Crosley Radio at one point!) needs help. I know I can likely buy a microfiche copy of the book from HP, but that costs.... and considering I paid a dollar for the pair in the rain at the Dayton Hamvention;-}	12
Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment (octave, 1/3 octave, etc). Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same amount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave. White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment (Hz, kHz, etc). Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of noise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide). Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave filter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs). Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network :-( Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements. It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands) as a flat line across the bands.	12

Marvin Minsky (hi there) writes of building "perceptrons?" in the 1950s using motor-driven potentiometers to vary the weights. He reported that the circuits worked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?) Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8. LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a few mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and eraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.	12

For those who would like to know, the 6507 was a 6502 without IRQ or NMI, and with only 13 address lines (giving 8K memory space). Didn't know about it being called the 6526 - thats the CIA found in the Commodore 64 (I don't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around). The TIA was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in the bottom 128 bytes of page 1. To get an image on the screen, you had to wait until the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line into the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many duplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the display. The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page 1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is both shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a machine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the high byte of the address is hardwired to 1). The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers (can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the 6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down. There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select.	12

How much software is out there for the Mac? I've been interested in using microcontrollers in imbedded applications for a long time, but was always under the impression that I would need an IBM to run the debug/compile/etc software. I would like to use a 6811 or 6816. I'm proficient in 6800 assembly, but have never NEEDED it except some toying with old 6802EVBs. Motorola doesn't seem to have any information on Mac software (at least their local distributor doesn't) and the ELE department around here has been of little help as well. I hope someone can tell me that I don't have to buy an IBM to work with the 6811 or 6816 Evaluation Boards...please send me mail! Andrew	12
I think a few things are being missed overall here... First of all, anyone with a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off of a hard disk. 'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks. They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to computer games. Those people are in the minority, however. In my experience with the world of people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will at some point copy a friend's program ("Gee, you really oughta try this") or accept a copy. These are people who normally would buy a software package or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter. The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one computer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * X# of computers for the same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially things like DOS upgrades.	12
Being in the "visualization" stage of a circuit design right now, I was wondering what the best way to "scale" an AC voltage using an 8-bit digital word is. I am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (converted to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of this method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b) creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference, but that would require more parts and boost the price further. Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8 bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip. Unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer; if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me. I am building this project as a "dimmer box" for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each box costs $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 = $2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed about today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive! Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!	12
TriQuint (Beaverton, Oregon), has been selling an 8 bit, 1 GHz D to A for several years. I have used it and it works well, faster settling time and smaller glitch area than any video d DACs I have seen. Also, they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale now - it's somewhere in the 10 to 12 bit area at 1 GHz.	12
Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack? * Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate? (by voltage I guess) If so, what hertz (pulse) rate are they adjustable or set to? I'd like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz, 10 hz, 15 hz, or 20 hz. Something like that... I'm interested in what's out there for flash rates. I like the idea of LEDs with flasher circuits already in them. I hate soldering ICs in general. Guess I don't have a hell of a lot of patience. Thanks,	12

The color of the board shows the composition of it, hence the use of it. Original and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown. Phenolic (spelling) was a tan Most "non filled" fiberglass boards used in computers are green. Filled fiberglass is blue. Teflon is white. As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them. First boards were used mainly in audio circuitry. Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because it would arc and burn. Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen by its use and cost. Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the fiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a capacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the high frequencies. Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses. Camcorders use this to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance. Am working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board is gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!! Hope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read.

I think all connections in Norway can handle touchtone dialing. The Oslo-region has one system, the rest of the country another system. (Almost right for pulsdialing.) Some phones have a little switch inside, so you are able to use them all over Norway, or you can just renumber the numbers on your phone.	12
Yes, it does. All the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be legal. What has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else. I'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden (at least when I read some information on it about tweo years ago). And BTW I do know that most of the lines in Sweden can handle tone-dialing, just don't be sure that all can.	12
Actually, no I don't have a tape drive. In the event of a total hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data from the backups I keep of that. With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard disk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape drive. :) Would be nice to have one though! Maybe, maybe not. Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope), but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS information is going to change, at least the date anyway. Tagging the BIOS manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard. This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk backup/restore. As long as it wasn't done too terribly often. Otherwise I think it would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software. Of course not. If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is "this software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to install it on other machines." Or something similar; Access for Windows does this and it only requires a click on "OK" to go away. Pretty non-intrusive, but it gets the point across. This is a great idea. I like the key system that some shareware products use. The only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users. -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu	12

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental psychologists at Bell Labs. When they were doing visual perception and memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond refresh rates common. So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either. Steve	12

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional or not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or input presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively coupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click. If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before switching with coupling capacitors of your own. If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input through to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change. This may mask the switch click. An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles use this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy. Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try. For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its older predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed prior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete and IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly). All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi-page article. Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the control pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins. Hope this helps at least get you started. -- -------------------------------------------------------------------- Dave Medin Phone: (205) 730-3169 (w) SSD--Networking (205) 837-1174 (h) Intergraph Corp.

One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask you for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and some self-rewriting code to confuse some people. Also, make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger. Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk, just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector. To help you here, you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph. Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in some random sector. Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the opposite of what you want. Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of. If the program does not find that this is the same system, it requests being installed by the original disk again. The original disk should be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied. Once again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed. Among other things, this also protects your program from virii. If the program detects a change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program. Tell them the program is "VIRUS SECURE", and remember, you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses. Feel good. I hope that I have helped. Have fun. Knock some cracking out (well, you can't do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in the process!). Goodbye.

Wrong, it has a 6507. It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood): the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list that as the CIA complex interface adapter.) TIA stands for Television Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware the 2600 possessed. There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer. That's all. Not according to the servicing documentation I have here. The 2600 did not change intenally very much at all. ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space. 2K and 4K games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching. Atari (and others) made much of these "huge" cartridges. Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT. This was multiply mapped into both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the bottom 4K of memory. TIA registers also sat in this address space. As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line to the cart. This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address the *very* scarce ROM address space.	12
I'm looking for some specs for a Toshiba TA6267-BP. It appears to be a power amp housed in a 7-pin inline package and is used in my Mitsubishi VCR, circa 1985, as a DC motor controller for the tape drive.

I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip, particulary a 27C512 EPROM. Although I don't know that much about it, as I understand it, there's a pin on the chip that, when voltage is applied, kicks up the address. The question is how do you determine how many bytes the address is incremented by?? For example, if I have code I want to be accessed at $2000 and also at say $4000 how do I move the address pointer to those positions?? Thanks for any info...	12
We use it as starting fluid for jet ski's. The fact that its a lubricant works very well since jet ski's are 2 cycle.

Just saw an article in New Scientist; AT&T videophones won't talk to (?)BTI videophones. The AT&T ones use a 19.2kb modem, BTI uses 14.4kb. AT&T models have to communicate using all AT&T exchanges, whereas the BTI can route via most current exchanges. Suggestions include building standards converters into telephone exchanges - the mind boggles :)= . The BTI design is a bit more conservative and is better able to cope with current data compression hardware on long-distance lines. (not having the magazine to hand, I may have mis-remembered BTI. I think it is a British one made by GEC-Marconi, and currently selling to other countries). Yet Another Standards Screw-up.	12
Oh, yeah. This is a fine place. We haven't had the "why does concrete kill lead-acid batteries" thread in at least six months. The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains them into the ground. Another explanation, implausible as it is, is that the lead-acid battery needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction. Naawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.	12
One way to make cheap trimmable resistors is to use a high-wattage carbon composition resistor, and saw a notch in it with a triangular file. Of course, you can only increase the resistance, not decrease it.	12
If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder, the ideal comunications would be over a multi-drop system, like RS-485. RS-485 boards are available for PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 is cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply 8-pin DIP driver chip. Software at the PC end would be similarly complex for either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion. The higher data rates possible with RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission. Hope this helps.	12
Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a "dry film" mask applied to them (usually applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner. There's a lot of info about the pro's and con's of each, but that's another story... Sla/n go fo/ill, Risky B.	12

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem to remember that PeP is actually 4x the "real" power. Which makes 1KW PeP actually around 250W. Or was it 2x? I disremember. "Effective transmitted power" is also "odd", in that it takes into account antenna height and geometry. Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the CN tower ;-). This is like Sears HP ;-) Though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible. About 125-150A with a 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages. It's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies). You'll feel it when you hit the key. But not too much.	12

Hi, I am looking an integrated circuits for my Z80-based computer. The circuit is called Z80-STI (Serial Timer Interrupt), MK3801, and made by Mostek. Mostek is called SGS Thompson today. I have been in contact with SGS Thompson, unfortunately they me told that Z80-STI is obsolete. So, my question is if anyone know if I can get hold of that circuits. Are there any companies that specialize in selling circuits that are no longer in production? I have contacted several electronic brokers in Sweden, but without any success. I would appreciate if you could give me hint where I should continue looking. Even companies in the United States would be fine, since this circuit is pretty crucial to me. Thanks in advance.	12

This is not a good idea.. I upgraded my motherboard last fall. I would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because I changed motherboards. Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum. Are you going to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb of RAM to their computer? I did that a couple of weeks ago. It's in the BIOS, and if software had told me "this isn't the machine you installed me on" I would never have used that software again. Really bad idea. This is silly. It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give them that. Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone. Do you know any assembly language at all? All anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction to just completely skip it. Not that difficult, really! And there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. Using PKLITE or some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE were tagged as uncompressable. This is by far the best idea you presented in your post. Making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the determined ones are just going to answer "Joe Blow" to the question of "what's your name" so this won't stop them in the long run. Pirates are always going to win this fight. They simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme. -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu	12
For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable leakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that is "causing interference to other services". Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and measurement technique. If you will clearly document your problem, and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the normal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong Cable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter to the local cable company, you will get results. In fact the cable company will probably start treating you much better when they realize you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention. What is important is to document your case as it relates to the applicable rules. However the cable company *is required* to at least check out every complaint of leakage. They must file with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement report that details the results of leakage testing. But remember, call the cable company first, and give them a chance to work to correct the problem before contacting the commission. I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via the airborne method.	12
This is a 1950s idea. Supposedly, splicing in a frame of "Buy popcorn" upped popcorn sales in a movie theatre. Big flap at the time. Congress involved. Talk of making it illegal. General agreement by networks not to do it. A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape with single-frame messages. It aired on a few stations, but a tech at one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at the tape frame-by-frame to find the "defect". Big flap. FCC notified. Commercial pulled. Press reports. Embarassed ad agency. You could probably find the press reports via Dialog or Nexis if you wanted. Now that everybody has VCRs, it's not likely that anybody could get away with this on TV.	12

I still think a major point is being missed... If you are worried about software pirates, NOTHING will stop them. These are people who crack software (mostly games, but so what) daily for fun.

Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies... (before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-) Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding) but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings. I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume :-) My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are 1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2) Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on my own (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any course that covers transistors ;-) So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what I'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? Take care. P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and (on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.

Uh, Bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature? On the time scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it's sitting on. Because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss. You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object (your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings. In the case of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final temperature. For the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze.	12

[heats of formation deleted] The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution. PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out. Also, H2SO4 is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--. Thus the heats of formation of PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant. As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing). (More about this later.) What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course) The battery slowly self discharges. As this discharge takes place two things happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved). -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like). Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate in a WATER (non-acid) solution. When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged) we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water. So PbSO4 forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms). The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery. If there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results. I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they are for the most part useless. They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly. You may have some success with these products for a newer battery. [stuff deleted] [stuff deleted] This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid. In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures. A logical consequence of the above argument is this: "If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to -50 to 'pull' the reaction along." We all know from experience (at least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is not true. If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery. (Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature. The air would amply dissipate any such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not. This is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool during storage.)	12
I don't know much about phones in Germany, but this is what I know: I bought a phone in the U.S. for my mother who lives in Bratislava, Slovakia and it works just fine. The problem is they don't have wall jacks like we do here. There is a wire without any jack at the end sticking out of the wall. So you need to connect the wires (I'm not sure if they have wall jacks in Western Europe - they may). Hope this helps. Dagmar kniha@carson.u.washington.edu	12
Oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry. Let's see if I can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind. <sounds of gears> <fumes of overheated oil> <unmistakable stench of the Nasal Chromatograph> Ha! I knew there was a double bond! Now how shall I show that in ASCII? MEK: Acetone: C - C - C - C C - C - C # # O O The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond. MEK has a methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other. Acetone has two methyls. So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead is dimethyl ketone. Both solvents have similar properties. I think that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe. It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was. Use acetone. Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone. If you buy some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need.	12

Hi Could someone please send me enough info to talk to a MK3801? It's some kind of multifunction peripheral chip made by Mostek I believe. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance Dave	12
Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one. Note, though, that you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation. The things are easy to dismantle. The key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when the camera is made. So no darkroom is needed for dismantling. It's standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing. All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin, and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another. If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery (still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera. I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really determined.	12

Probably won't help. I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer used those little self-contained modules. I think Sharp made them. Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.) The module had 3 leads: power, ground and demodulated output. It contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator all in a tiny metal can. If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can probably order one. BTW - the carrier frequency is 40 KHz, and each different TV/VCR/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.	12
Some TV's, including my RCA set at home, uses simple carriers which I think run between 32 and 36 or 38 KHz. There is no tone decoding in it. All one has to do to piss the thing off :-) is just hook an IRLED up to a variable oscillator and tune through. Wreaks all kinds of havoc. :-) Similarly, my VCR remote changes channels on my cable box. Always seems to change the cable box to channel 5 when you do the pause/play. SOOOO, some things do have some overlap to them.	12

Here is a list I get when I was combing through some microfilm one day here at Drexel while completely board. Most of these circuits are pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice. This is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff (not a good word, but I'm tired right now). Hope you enjoy! If you have any additions send them to me and I'll add them to the list . They don't have to be from this particular magazine, they just have to be interesting!

A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about 6"x8" or so that could be plugged into (something) and they would glow. One was red, another green, another blue. Interresting. I was wondering if anyone would have a feed on anything of this nature, and of the price. oh, the pads were rubber-like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or so. Thanks. _________________________________________________ Inspiration | ___ | comes to | \ o baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca | those who | ( ^ ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca | seek the | /-\ =] Baden de Bari [= | unknown. | |	12
You're right, it is HAPP Controls, Inc., but you can buy direct from them. I don't have a phone number with me, but anyone interested in it can email me for it. I don't remember their button price, but the joystick price was $8.95 per dozen at last check. Should be slightly higher for one or two, but cheaper than Parts Express. As for the trackballs, i don't know the new price either. But I can sell you rebuilt arcade trackballs for $50. That includes new rollers and new bearings (when nec.). I also have a pile of used joysticks and buttons that i would be willing to sell. Please email to address below if interested. --Donnie	12

Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost recovery on? I may be interested. I think for practical and cost reasons I am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to extend range. Yes I'm interested in the company name. I have access to an extensive data book collection. With that kind of power, are we getting into an area where eye safety is getting to be a problem. They are a long way from me but they might be a better source than I can find around here. I'm keeping my application confidential for now. Raising the frequency should be no problem, in fact one respondent to my question said that I may not have to mimic the 50% duty cycle normally used by IR detector chips. --	12
I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post. Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries. One year, I left the batteries in the garage. The garage is Unheated. They were left in their places that they needed to be. One in the riding lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle. The battery in the riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries was new, and one was around 5 years old. Upon spring time, I discovered that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged. They all worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer. (they had originally been stored in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring) Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts. one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete. I brought in all three, and discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said "HMMMMMMMM" and the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000 (In other words, it was pinned) the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries. They were the same. Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead acid, I decided to put the charger on them. (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle. I tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they worked fine for around 25 of 'em. This leads me to believe one of several things. 1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true) 2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries. 3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is, 4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete. (BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)	12
Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago. I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's). The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one (small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so. My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are: Advantages: Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....) Disadvantages. Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink (I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts (I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to $12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales. In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript (unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB negatives directly onto a transparency.	12
Probably, but the point is THE COMPANY make the registration patch, NOT YOU. Sure, you can probably find another registerred user and compare notes, but WHY? It's not hindering you in any way unless you are just hacking. [Problem about people who cut TOO MUCH from quoting...] Nothing, but if you read my WHOLE suggestion, I'm saying that you register via MAIL by mailing in your registration card, THEN the company send you the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card.	12
Fiberglass boards are available in several colors. Sitting right here, I have unetched board stock that is white, blue, green and yellow respectively. I've also seen black boards. Solder mask is available in a variety of colors too. Depending on the supplier, the color helps indentify the material. Don't forget conformal coating. I don't think I've seen phenolic impregnated paper boards in anything other than the familar brown, but it would not be difficult to add a dye to change the color.	12

[stuff deleted] You should be clear in your mind what your goal is. Two possible goals are (1) maximizing you income from your program, and (2) minimizing the number of illegal copies which get created. Accomplishing (2) doesn't usually accomplish (1). Most vendors have concluded that copy protection reduces the number of normal legitimate sales by far more than it increase sales by virtue of changing 'copiers' to 'purchasers', and hence merely reduces revenue. Most legitimate buyers nowadays (including me) have had bad experiences with copy protected products (e.g., hard to make a legitimate backup, incompatabilties when new system on system upgrade, etc.), and they won't touch them with a ten foot pole.	12
Anyone claiming that 1500 "real watts" isn't possible in a mobile should dig through their back issues of 73 (and, I think, QST) for a description of the mobile installation of that most revered of OMs, W6AM. As I recall, this included a Heath 1kW (DC in) amp (what was that model number...SB- something.... my mind is turning to the usual Friday mush...) and was run full-out CW fairly regulary. The car's electrical system had been modified, including a rather seriously-heavy-duty alternator, but such an installation HAS been done, and so IS possible. This installation was the source of the legendary story of W6AM sitting in the car, and paging his wife over the department store PA systems!	12
Wayne: Look for these advertised in sailboat supplies catalogs and sail-related magazines (eg. SAIL ...).	12
You are quite correct in your understanding. The filtering is not interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to. Generally, these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network. I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's heart, and the effect is rather spooky. It actually reconstructs peaks that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point. I use a CPU to do all the math. It takes a decent (but not unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this. You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code. In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) filter. I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method. Anybody out there know the real answer? I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering. This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs. Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic. I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not. You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp. It's too bad that they charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build. I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better. They are built to a price spec, and that spec says "cheap as possible!". -dave	12
IN ORDER to get the 15 nS response time you need, you are better off going to an ECL slicer which can run off a single +5 or -5.2 V supply, you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the range. Check out the ECL 10K books for a simple cheap solution.	12
It's not the temperature, it's the karma. You see, dirt has good karma, since it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared off and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process. Being a karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no longer able to keep a charge. Because wood is also good and organic, putting a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.	12
I've come across a circuit from Integrated Circuit Systems Inc called a GSP500. This chip genlocks a VGA card to a dual input NTSC signal. The output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various speeds. I notice that it outputs a 28mhz clock.. can this output be used on an Amiga system? And must it be NTSC/VGA or can it be NTSC/NTSC ? Any simple circuits to boost an NTSC to a VGA signal? Need to genlock a laser disc to my 31khz video. -John	12
The lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following chemical reaction: Pb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 --> 2PbSO4 + 2H20 Lead and Lead (IV) Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water The standard heats of formation at 25 C (77 F) of the various compounds are: Heat of formation Compound at 25 C, kcal/mole -------- ------------------ Pb 0.00 PbO2 -65.0 H2SO4 -193.69 PbSO4 -218.5 H20 -68.3174 The heat of reaction at 25 C is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole PbSO4 produced. Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery. (I am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be wrong. Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel like thinking through it right now.) What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be, is exothermic, or energy discharging. If moisture with dissolved electrolytes (acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals may form. This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds. The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery charger) is put back into the battery. Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge. Each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction. The non-reacting posts (terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric energy during a discharge (or charge). Because the reaction is exothermic, it has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances. So while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution. To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's Principle, which can be paraphrased as: anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position. Here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials: thermal conductivity material Temperature, C (F) BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft) -------- ------------------ -------------------- diatomaceous earth, 204 0.051 natural, across strata 871 0.077 diatomaceous, natural, 204 0.081 parallel to strata 871 0.106 diatomaceous earth powder (100) 0.039 (density, 18 lb/cu.ft) (200) 0.042 (300) 0.044 (400) 0.048 (500) 0.051 concrete (cinder) --- 0.20 (stone) --- 0.54 (1:4 dry) --- 0.44 pine (across grain) 15 0.087 (parallel to grain) 21 0.20 oak (across grain) 15 0.12 maple (across grain) 50 0.11 Note that the thermal conductivity for "dirt" (diatomaceous earth) goes down with temperature. Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth. The thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4 times greater than wood. It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood. At any instant the discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity or heat. (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).) During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat. The higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface. Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature, the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt. This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play. Removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion. If the reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced. A concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface. Store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which "pulls" the reaction along. Also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water. This will tend to drive the discharge reaction. Jeff White jhwhit01@ulkyvx.louisville.edu	12
Wonder if anyone would know where (or if) I could find the schematic for the old Timex-sinclare (sp) computer... Or even a pin out on the expansion bus??	12
I think its a great, but idealistic idea. A reseacher will first of all try to publish a worthy paper in a credible, professional magazine and not in a community like USENET which is infamous for lots (not all) of junk information. The papers that will be "published" here will, in general, be of low quality. Also, it is improbable that any credit will be given to a researcher who publish here - and sadly, that is nowadays a main reason for publishing. USENET is great for informal discussions and free exchange of ideas - keep it like that. A new, specialist group is just not worth it.	12
No. The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milky-white plastic. And, fyi, putting a filter on a "typical visible light LED" (presumably meaning a non-blue one) won't produce blue light. A filter can only block light, it can't generate wavelengths that aren't there to start with.	12
: : >What kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects? : >The affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road... : : Might be a couple of hundred watts, from the sound of it. Kicking sound : out of the TV and stereo speakers by direct RF rectification requires a : mighty strong carrier! [I've heard of linears so powerful that : triggering them while the car was idling, would stall the engine by : pulling down the battery voltage.] It would take a lot more than that. It sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off - but just goes to a standby situation. I suspect that the stories are just that, stories. The voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones car, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car just does not crank well. Now, the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed will drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement. : >Is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company, the fcc, or both? : : Ultimately it's likely to be your problem to resolve, I'm afraid.

I just got caller-id (except Bell calls it "call display" and didn't know what I was talking about when I asked for "caller-id"). I got the cheapest display box I could find, and hope to convert it to serial out. The chip used is an 18-pin DIP marked "CDT 14-285" and "1473 9220". I presume the 9220 is the date. I'm hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip, to save me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope, asking my friends to call me again and again. I'll post any interesting replies, and my experiences. -simon tooke	12

Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. The MAX7219 drives 8 7 segment LED displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete LED's with a 3 wire serial interface. The chips can also be cascaded to allow very large arrays. I am working on a sign display using this part. I'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later, it's at home. There was a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Ink's. Mike Harpe	12
Hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers? Just a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool. I have the clues on type A, B, and AB already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned occasionally and I dont know what they do. I think type D is like a PWM scheme or something. Thanx in advanced.	12
I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should use to clean duct-tape adhesive from carpet? Someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out. Is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax? (whatever that is ... but it just barely ties this query into sci.electronics) Thanks for your help Best regards, ruck	12

I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed individually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so). Is there an LSI that is designed to drive an LED array (including RAM to hold the array state), or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have to latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch? (I want to avoid having a huge board covered with 373s if possible!) Thanks in advance...	12

See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage Regulator, (National) part number: LM350T or LM350K. These devices are rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts @ 3 Amps. Digi-Key Corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators. If you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: 1-800-344-4539. I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7.5 VDC nicad battery with this device, and if I'm right, you may want to look through some of the hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first. If you get stuck, e-mail me your FAX number, if you have one, and I'll send you some suggestions or schematics.	12
Hi. Our problem is the following: We have to design an RF link for a distance of 250 m. We're using standard RS232 waves (square pulses) as the modulating waves and the carrier wave is sinusoidal. The link has to be bidirectional. We would appreciate any advice on the type of modulating techniques or antennas that we should use. Please internet email us at: 007gjf3@witsvma.wits.ac.za (Nando) or 007bww3@witsvma.wits.ac.za (Warren) or blumenow@underdog.ee.wits.ac.za (Warren) Thank you very much in advance.	12
I've been wondering about this myself. The house wiring thing is really hokey. There is no doubt that high pressure ultrasound is annoying, but to whom? Given that these devices have been advertised to be effective against everything from insects to rodents to nasty dogs, what is to say that my insect repeller won't just annnoy my dog and give me headaches? Could there be that much selectivity in frequencies? Have there been ANY studies on the effects of various pressure levels, bands, and sweep patterns on various life forms? And how effective could they be? I certainly would not want to tell anyone that they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric buzzer...	12

I remember, back before commercial mikes with the "PZM" label (for Pressure Zone Microphone) started showing up, I read an article, in some engineering journal, that described the principles involved. All the physics aside, from a practicle standpoint the author's said they built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier mike laid up against a large aluminum disk. In demonstrating it at a presentation to audio engineers, this was impressive enough that the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them. Anyway...I want to build some to use as "choir mikes" (wide coverage). I've had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got from Digi-Key - most of these are limited-bandwidth, peakey units but for a buck or two more I got the ones spec'd to go out to 20kHz with a bit flatter response. The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of critical. I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, which puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mounting it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a small clearance. I haven't dissected a unit like you can buy at Radio Shack to see how they do it. Thoughts?	12
Hmmm... how about a piece of copper wire? 0 to 5V input range, standard TTL output, instantaneous conversion time! [ (-: for the humor impaired ]	12
I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU. I have the Motorola MC68030UM/AD Rev. 1, but I fear it is out of date as it does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi. What I need is the Theta (JC) Thermal Characteristic (the Junction to Case thermal resistance) for the _PLASTIC_ FE style package. If you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings suffer a few days delay here. If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value for the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 W maximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases). If your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what it reads at 25 C and 40 C. Thanks for reading!	12
When will people learn! The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to contact the ballast. Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full charge for > 2 years so it must be possible. If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous). Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and counting)	12
Typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap FIR, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit. At this kind of speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less expensive than analog components of comparable precision. I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for an old CD player design; where one would find similar info for a particular CD (the digital filter IS an interesting component, from my point of view), I have no idea. The digital filter is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical analysis, to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation' is...),	12
What I usually use...and this stuff is only good on glass....is either Acetone, or a little Benzene. The latter of the two is a bit dangerous (possibly a carcinogen(sp?)) but it usualy gets the job done. I imagine you can you the two solvents on most metals as well as glass, but keep the stuff away from plastic. Better yet, you may just want to go to your local hardware store and ask them what they use.	12
Sorry Ian, I haven't toyed with it in several years. I haven't seen the insides in quite a few years. I just saw the post lagging for quite a few days, and thought I'd toss in my $0.02. I assume the 6507 was functionally similar to the 6502 (was it also made by MOS Technologies?). I really am more versed in the (6502 based) Atari computers. The 2600 came later on. In the Atari computers, the "CIA" chip you refer to sounds an awful lot like the CTIA (Color Television Interface Adapter) chip used in the early models. Later Atari upgraded this to the GTIA (Graphics ...). Other colorful literature stated that the GTIA might have stood for "George," the developer of the chip. Funny, I had an old and new model. The old one was SIGNIFICANTLY heavier. Sorry, I am way out of line here. My first microcontroller I built was a MC68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. That was not easy to work with (in addtion to a small 2K on-board EPROM).	12

Once upon a time, long long ago in this news group, someone posted a schematic for a 1-bit A/D converter. Well I just found a use for the little monster. Anyone out there still got this text file? It had a flip-flop, a resistor and a cap, and a comparator/op-amp I think. I would be extremely thankful to anyone who could mail me the schematic or post it to the news-group.	12
I don't know for sure that this will work, but you might try MEK (methyl ethyl keytone?). It worked getting the stickum left over from shelf paper, and is available at paint stores. Use a carbon gas mask and lots of ventilation--this stuff really stinks!	12
the unuseable) motorcycle What happens is that (I heard this discussed on "Northern Exposure") there is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the molecules in the concrete. This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete combination. Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES! Remedy: Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.	12
What kind of CSA/UL/FCC approval do $60+ mail-order PC computer cases and power supplies have? Can I assume that the certification process for small-scale custom hardware (ie digital/analog circuitry) is reduced, or even eliminated, if I use such a case and (certified) power supply?	12
Hi, I am looking for a very high speed D/A converter (at least 8bits and 150MHz) for a research application. A paper in the January issue of IEEE Solid-State Circuits mentions a GaAs, 1GHz, 8bit DAC - anyone know where I can find such a thing? Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would do. Needless to say, I have looked in all the conventional places (Vitesse, Motorola, National, etc. etc.). Any pointers would be appreciated.	12

I hate to disagree, but I will. :) (note: I don't pirate software, nor do I trade it. I simply have met and talked extensively with those who have. that's it. the FBI can tap someone else's phone :) Most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate. A cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s). I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving' copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use on one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks? It's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since "someone's already paid for it", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much though.) what about commercially available copy programs? CopyII? how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't? and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldn't know about this: after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that the 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least 200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who are doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few arguments to the dir command. really? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster, but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you jump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too! But I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written down. what if they need to re-install? The idea of a backup still holds- if the original disk goes bad, they're out of luck for about 1-2 weeks, which is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks- if they'll do it without a charge.	12
This is called silver bearing solder. It is used to solder to devices that have silvered contacts. One application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes. These were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches. If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic. The silver was quite thin. The 2% is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead. Thus, no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution. Other devices that use silver contacts are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.	12
They've been out of busines for years. Not any more. About 2 years ago they all closed. When Ramco/Electronics city closed, it took weeks and many dumpsters to clear everything out (so I heard). There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires, but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff. Sylvan/Wellington is still on Broadway and Canal, but they're not cheap, and not surplus. It's mostly a TV repairman's store. -- Jeffrey Jonas jeffj@panix.com -- Jeffrey Jonas	12
Ah-ha! I'm not alone at last! Which Sony do you have?? I have a 27"SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987). That damn thing used to make noise like a mad-man. I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke came together. First: I found by poking around the windings on that assembly, the thing would make noise. I guess that there was enough of a potential in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic. That fixed it. Second: Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one. If I leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet. If I put the cover back on, and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the cover on!! :-( A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole leak somewhere on the flyback. Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of black dust/dirt. I hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!	12

I know of at least one ftp-site from which you can download the cracks of about any commercial game in existence. The names of the companies (yes, companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own convenience. If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such company. I will not give the name of this ftp-site to anyone, even if only to protect the companies which wrote the original games. DISCLAIMER: I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs. I believe it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run. On the subject of copy protection: Most pirates don't give a damn about using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting the program. They just don't have a conscience.	12
Does anyone know where to get a schematic for a micro stepping circuit? Any help would be appreciated. mcole@nmsu.edu	12
Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example, the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 feet altitude. Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad, but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort. Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E. should know about anyway ;-). This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also... Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength. This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes. Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong... As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 GHz. Hope this helps...	12
Check the station's master sync generator. You'll probably find that it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't being used. A couple of cables and you're in business. Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD outputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to the cameras. If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync separator. Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators - they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.	12

Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like switching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called "class S" before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable for very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile amp, though. I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year (to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems with layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help with a do-able isolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that operates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver amps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit (I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and I beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that it had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat) under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high current at the zero-voltage crossings).	12

Phototransistor-> X100 -> X100 -> NE567 with 330Kohm Limiter feedback to base to control operating point (I expect this really hurts Noise Figure! Any comments from Phototransistor experts?) We intended to use this atop a stepper motor, to provide headings to the beacons. The plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons, of different frequencies, in each room, and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to. We did not do so. One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps! Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going to explain resection over the net.)	12

What are people's opinions about laser detectors? Escort makes a laser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine. However, I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector. Otherwise it won't work. Regular radar, of course, travels in all directions; hence it is more detectable. Any comments? Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy their wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll save $60 off of buying them separately. In this case, the addition of the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport 1000 normally costs $100). -- Eddie Gornish University of Illinois - Center for Supercomputing Research & Development	12
Hi, folks out there ! I don't know whether I am in the right newsgroup, but I have a question. If I am completely wrong here in this group, could you mail me the right name of the correct newsgroup ? A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in Karlsruhe/Germany since one year. He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control engineering in the U.S.A. . Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the U.S.A. ? Could you send me information like (e-mail)adresses of the universities, "quality" of these studies, and so on ? Is it possible to e-mail the universities directly to get information ? Do the universities send information via e-mail ? Please could you answer via e-mail, because I don't read this newsgroup regularly. Thanks in advance. Stephan Jaeger	12

If you want slow LED flash rates, adjustable by switches (or by a 4066/4016 digitally controlled switch), I suggest looking at a 555 oscillator chip. They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a 555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz to about 500 KHz (I think). About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise. The data line is probably most easily done by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565 chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with. Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is going into, so I am really generalizing... As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making. Hope that clears things......	12

Think video. Brooktree sells a whole line of DACs that can be used, normally for graphics applications, in either 50 or 75 ohm systems. For example, the BT468 can be had in speeds up to about 200 mHz, BT492 to 360 mHz, and 400 mHz with the BT109.	12
They do interpolate - it's not linear interpolation though. You are correct that the frequency content is not altered (more specifically, the baseband spectrum is preserved, and so is every Nth image spectrum. The other (N-1) in N image spectra are removed, where N is the oversampling rate) Ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz, and a gain of 0 from 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency. In practice a finite transition band is required, and there is also a certain amount of pass-band ripple and stop-band leakage. With a high order (eg 200 taps) digital filter, a very good approximation can be easily achieved. <<< BIT DELETED ABOUT OBSERVATIONS OF INTERPOLATION FILTER AT WORK >>> No, they actually use a digital FIR just like yours, but built in hardware, on custom VLSI chips for (mainly) economic reasons. I guess that the answer is somewhere between the two. As an interesting (?) aside, some of you out there may be aware of a scheme used by Pioneer and Wadia, which is called (by Pioneer, at least) Legato Link. I haven't heard one of these players, but by reading advertising blurb, and a couple of pseudo-technical articles I deduced that all they do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter, and let a load of the first image (ie aliassed) spectrum through. Talking to Bob Stuart (of Boothroyd Stuart, aka Meridian) confirmed my suspicion. He said that it sounded awful, but then he would, wouldn't he... Christopher	12
Pink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency components than white noise. If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal. Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more low-frequency components. The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why. Enjoy it.	12
Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice. The chemical is called d-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract of some kind). You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store -- it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid. It works on sticker glue, crayons, grease, oil, etc. It's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.	12
Hello, I'm looking for information on Alphanumeric pagers and *how* the data is sent from the paging transmitter and how I would go about building a device to decode the paging data (like my pager does) and feed it though an RS232 port.

Does anyone know what chips (Motorola?) are good for decoding Numeric and Alphanumeric paging data (and then stuffing it down an RS232 port (basically any baud rate is fine!) ?

From "Management of Electronics Assembly" (Ian Oakes) After talking about 63/37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point... "Occasionally, impurities may be added to solder, to vary charactersitics within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance. For example, addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce the amount solder moves under stress when solid. For particular applications additions of impurities may be warranted but, in general, it is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible." I guess this is the good oil for commercial operations, but it doesn't mention anything esoteric.	12
Mike, Ring is the RED wire. Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard phone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack. Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to GREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the voltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position). I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere). Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts DC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current loop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).	12

They are real, and we still pay licence fees to receive TV. The detector vans pick up the IF, true. This tells them what channel you are watching. The can also pick up the line time base freq, and frame rate (Try it with a LW/MW radio near telly, it picks up a sharp hum) From this they can even watch (poor quality though) what *you* have on the screen, by picking up re radiating junk.	12
Yes. It's called RADAR. Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this concept. What is the difference between vertical and horizontal?	12
With regards to what you wrote, how does one "adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that"? I asked a professor that question just last week and he didn't really know himself. Since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's a lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and since this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't able to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that? It seems to me that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise. I have seen the "pink noise" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to "man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc. If you have any information about this, it would be appreciated. Hope this didn't sound too drawn out. Thanx.	12

This would be susceptible to fading, multi-path etc. We used to use a system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa. It used a 10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured. The 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched ones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units came with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp. They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end. Current technology uses polarized reflectors, dual polaization TX/RX and psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution at X band, much better at 47GHz. (Only one end is heavy :-) ). Regards, Stu Beal, VE3MWM, U009@CSX.CCIW.CA, National Water Research Institute, Burlington, Ontario, Canada.	12

The question is if the general electronics work > the same. I can buy a different wall plug and refit it (I'm sure I'd > have to), but would that do the trick? Two things to watch for: In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dialing. In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and in the process converting numbers) an interesting task. Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign phone to either the German or Swedish phone system. OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course illegal. As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecom operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue. I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMF dialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have been retrofitted with "magic fingers" that converts from DTMF to pulse dialing. Thomas	12

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT, that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about. Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like. IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug it in and go to FDISK.	3
No. The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA. The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction. This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data. Only the smart drive controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA. These controllers tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI. To get the DMA benefits, IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*. Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't an IDE issue. The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands. The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent. They each have their own controller. They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data. The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business. Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed. Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted. IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback. Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system? --David Willmore -- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- willmore@iastate.edu | "Death before dishonor" | "Better dead than greek" | David Willmore | "Ever noticed how much they look like orchids?

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try replacing the battery. If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.	3
Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5" hard drive, model LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior. Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks. When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not the drive.] My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind behavior.

My friend claims that there will be > little difference > in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a > computationally > intensive job. From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually "idle". They will continue to service interrupts, etc., etc. The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it's doing. I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions, but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be negligible.

hartzman@kilroy.Jpl.Nasa.Gov (Les Hartzman) writes... Les, I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor. It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?) issue of PC Magazine. As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types. There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's Extremely Low Frequency). The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both. But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified" only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other. So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low emissions as the Hitachi. I like my image quality, but for all I know you may be more discerning. Good luck! - Mitch v063kcbp@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu	3

I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as fast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it. Also, the 17 does claim to be able to support 1600x1280, but I have no experience with that. Since I have the spec sheet in front of me I'll type some in: CRT: 17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, RGB mediou short persisance, Tint (TM=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection Input Signal: RGB Analog 0.7Vp-p, 75 ohms (also has setting for 1Vp-p) Sync: H/V Separate(ttl), composite (+/-), sync on green (+/-) horizontal freq: 30-82Khz, vertical freq: 50-90Hz compatibility: PC from VGA to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac IIci and above controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off. video band witdth: 135 MHz Max brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner dimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lbs I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just typed them in. Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple dynamic astigmatism focus'. Right. They mean they use two lenses. Advanced Invar shadow mask. ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output. As near as I have been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green, and blue. How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me. But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at. Sharp, clear, and isn't nearly as bad as the NEC's for reflections.	3
We are doing a research about a passive dynamic vision guided vehicle. Completed the first theoric part, we have to make the effective realization of this vehicle. We need the necessary hardware for image acquisition from a videocamera and for their subsequent elaboration (tipically: edge detection). We ask for informations about available products in the market for this purpose (in real time, 20-25 frames/second). Hence we need frame-grabber cards and/or DSP cards for SUN or PC platform. We are also very interested in receiving comments and suggestions from users of these cards, especially about programming tools. Furthermore we are looking for the same kind of informations about digital controlled Pan&Tilt devices. Thanks in advance Best regards Enrico Fedrigo	3

I have a 286 with a Western Digital WD-93044A hard drive. This drive is 782 cylinders with 4 read write heads PHYSICALLY, but LOGICALLY it is 977 cylinders with 5 read write heads (??!!). In the CMOS setting I am instructed to set it to type 17 (IBM 977 cyl. 5 read/write heads), THE PROBLEM: I was sent Western Digitals ISPFMT low level program from the manufacturer, and was instructed to run it on the hard drive with the CMOS setting set to type 17. This worked "o.k." and I verified the disk using the same program. I then reloaded DOS which did a high level format, again no errors, no bad sectors, etc. BUT.... when I run Norton Speedisk 6.01 (or any other disk optimizer) with the verify option set ON, I get ERROR verifying sector NNNN, where NNNN can be any number (not the same all the time). ANY IDEAS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WOULD BE APPRECIATED! Thank you!	3
I have got an Adaptec SCSI card, that comes with its own version of FDISK. The problem with DOS is that it will only see two hard disks, any more need to be done by device drivers.	3

hi folks i have a 386 25 mhz and now i'm buying a new 486 first question) which is the best way to share hard disks and printer p.s. my two pc will be far about 10 meter and i like to use a parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource under dos linux os2.1 and windows 3.1 & nt 2) which 486? i think to buy 486 dx2 50mzh local bus but i heard that some board coulnd't work properly cause some incompatibilites is that true? should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated svga card with a normal local bus ide controller or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated with a normal ide controller? 3) is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color svga card? at which price? 4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read musical photo kodak and computer cd rom i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best? and which controller work with its?	3
I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM. It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers. The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours. Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours. Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using Hint chipsets. Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab. Using ET4000/W32 drivers 640x480 256 10.63 megapixel/sec. 32k 7.34 64k 7.30 800x600 256 10.07 32k 6.38 64k 6.35 1kx786 256 8.17 Using ET4000 drivers. 640x480 16M 1.78 800x600 16colours 4.01 1kx786 16 4.22 From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card. The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer. It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution. From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card in 256 colours mode.	3
The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple and Fluke 55 dig thermometer). This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc. This is in a Micron computer, without heatsink. I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off. It makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to the pins on the cpu etc...	3

HELP! I am trying to view .JPG files with my 386SX, 20MHz machine . I have a STB-POWERGRAPH graphics card with 1024 X 768 by 256 colors, with 1Meg RAM on it. I have tried CVIEW097 (with windows-- EXTREMELY SLOW), and DVPEG24. DVPEG24 doesn't work!

One of the things going for the DX2-66 (over the 50) is that it's clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec. Lance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com) Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.	3
You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error Checking enabled or disabled. I assume you mean it gives you a parity error when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled. How high will the count go on the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs? Does the system beep at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps? The error could be occuring in Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms. The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board manufacturer either. Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some simm sockets to make your board. I tend to doubt your problem is with your IDE controller, also. Anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.	3
I have both! I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box. IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it has a SCSI hard disk, CD-ROM and tape. I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up. Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy does have a 9ms average seek time. I.E it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms Toshiba drive. I don't think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus :-( 890KB/s is pretty good... Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the art IDE drives. Only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520MB Fijitsu drive for an example! I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and no-name IDE cards on both. Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it. A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain! Guy	3

It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible 486DLC and 486DRU2. My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service: And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80. The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA). The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds. the 25, the 33, and the 40. They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any software query will return coproc as present. I guess they emulate the coproc instructions. Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor. The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K. Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit rate. My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance boost when it is enabled by software. Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%. The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones. The performance, with the cache enabled, is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is around the performance for a 486SX-25. The computer runs noticebly faster, and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining. The company claims OS/2 compatibility, but I didn't test it. The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought. The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler. This board plugs into the 386DX PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board. I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required. There are no info available from Cyrix there. Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20 only. Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs. If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor. With 64K external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX. IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or can't install, a new motherboard. It is definitely worth what I paid for it, but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it. I'm not sure about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't beat it in any significant way. The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail, asking where I got it. So here is where I got mine: Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper. 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00 But.... I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer. If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you more info. I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use, So I can;t post anymore info here. However, if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can. jamesc 909-396-0408	3

: Hi! : : Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software : programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card? : : Thanks in Advance! : : -- : =-Dave *Tigger!* : : djohnson@moose.uvm.edu 'Tiggers are wonderful things!' : Dave C Johnson I think you mean the ethernet numbers. The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence. This is a "physical layer" concept. The IP address is a higher layer protocol. The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or I) physical identification scheme (number). But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number) it is not supposed to be possible to change the number. Of course the manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a reason to ever do that. If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly changable. But it is strictly software.	3

Gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people who responded to the original request for help. The ATI VLB video board uses the addresses for COM 4. They could suggest no work around. I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse. This will free up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know enough about the hardware. Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no problems with any other hardware or software.	3

Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT: If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software, there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards. This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware: it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips (specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure agreements. This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide X-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to divulge programming neccessities. As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info.	3

: : I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem : cable. (Actually I have NO idea, so don't count that last statement.) What I'm : asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?) I just want : to solder one myself instead of buying one. I don't even know what port is : used. : : Help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu) : : Kevin : : p.s. I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or : Telix. Ideas and info gladly accepted.) I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null- modem cable. The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications. The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems, but you should still check your software! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232. RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem. Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware. The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA Communications Equipment (DCE). RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols. The connector is a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9. The primary signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG). There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE. For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal. DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE. Similarly, the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR) signal. DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE. Ok that's five signals; there are only four more of interest. The Request To Send (RTS) signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data. If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal. (For completeness, the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE). The other two signals (of interest) are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD). These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE. RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE. This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup. DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE. There - that's it. Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete. I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC. The pinouts are as follows: Name DB-9 DB-25 SG 5 7 TD 3 2 RD 2 3 DTR 4 20 DSR 6 6 DCD 1 8 RTS 7 4 CTS 8 5 RI 9 22 Now to address your problem at hand. When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions don't work out quite right. There is no DCE to assert the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI. So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well. If this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG, and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end, etc). The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready. It would have to just send the data and hope it got through. Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed. A particular point a confusion is in the software area. Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them. If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used. But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap- Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements. The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD. The DTR/DSR is also fairly common. There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here. And that is flow control. In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the DTE. By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first. Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send. And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow control? The answser is usually. But how? For non-binary communications, one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands. This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals. (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape" codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered). The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard. There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried. One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction. But beyond that anything is fair game. Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage. By the way, I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve. This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software. The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software. For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS). Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires). Specifically I am talking about the DSR. Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this. It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose. One more "gotcha" signal is the DCD. Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to see the DCD before it will work. This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR. But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD. And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through. This null modem works with most software. The flow control, if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR. If your comm. package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use this one. TD ------ RD RD ------ TD DTR ------ DSR DSR ------ DTR DCD ------ RTS-\ /-RTS ------ DCD | \-CTS CTS-/	3
1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games. After leaving F-15 III it would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:. This has been fixed. I don't know what other corrections were made. 2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work. 3) Download glb05.exe. Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a config.sys or autoexec.bat. Run the self extracting archive so all the files explode to the disk. Run the file fsh.exe. It should be self-explanatory from there. Dan P.S.: I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so I uploaded the file to ftp.cica.indiana too..	3
No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks. Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to fight with any low memory problems either.	3

In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present. Get it right! 3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to pin 1. No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable. Be sure of pin 1 on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok but assumptions are bad). 4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct, then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

Probably not but I understand your predicament - You will probably throw salt over your shoulders, wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant while dancing around the room if someone said it might help.

I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. I'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know if i can use a DX/2 66Mhz cpu. The BIOS is late model AMI, circa 1991, and the system crystal is approx 66.3Mhz. My question is, can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new DX/2 cpu? If its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans??	3
I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast. It's a long card that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans. It requires no extra cabling. I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to heat. The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no longer appears. It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the maker's (M.S. Tech) advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running (w/o a/c) in Desert Storm. I can't vouch for that. However, I am a satisfied customer. And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order house (Lyben (313) 268-8100). Hope this helps,	3
Recently, I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my computer. It doesn't happen everytime I turn it on, nor can I predict when it is going to happen.

In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them). If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions. This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz. note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows. Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions. I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed. There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it. This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure. If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it, then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and replace your chip with it. You should get about 95% better preformance for both normal and math functions. The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700. The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have. Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. If you have a 20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally. There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance. You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week. You might want to shop around as prices do vary. If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources. Lawrence Khoo	3
Hi, I have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. No monitor isn't a program - but no keyboard. I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup). I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor. Pity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail. So does anyone of you experts can help? Thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-) Thomas	3
My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are: 1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new? 2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take? 3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California). 4. What is the most up-to-date version? 5. Very important. How much would it be?

Build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for instance, if you have Crystal Fonts enabled. Some other problems-- "color darkening" and some others. I don't use the drivers in any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the other modes I can't say. To be honest, up until now, I have only found one bug in the Diamond Viper drivers, and it seems innocuous. That is, under Microsoft Word, select Format Border, click shading and take a look at the patterns. The 5% pattern has been swapped with the 90%, and so on. The whole list is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take it to another machine (i.e., a GUP or ss24x machine) or print it and iy shows--badly! Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so I can't speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty solid. -- "What's big, noisy and has an IQ of 8?"	3
This isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well. I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them). I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus's part but I don't think so. From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison: Wintach Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 9.33 10.34 20.78 8.28 14.90 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster 9.88 8.65 11.71 18.84 15.40 13.65 Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review. Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at least that was what the program said.	3
I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow!	3
Hi all. I've been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several terms that I'm not sure about. 1.) Hard Sectored/Soft Sectored -- What's the difference? How do I know which to use? 2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related to performance... How do I know what's optimal?

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'. There several reasons for this :- When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and the data can be transmitted. When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored somewhere while the disk is writing it out. In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache! May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well... Guy	3

Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC. By this I mean of different types. ie. RLL and MFM. If so how do you access the drives in the CMOS setup. Do they just show up to be configured or do you have to do low level writes to the controller. As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine. Put a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it. I now have 4 drives with 2 controllers of different types. Also can you put 2 controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access them. I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased Thanx in advance for any info...	3

Hello, I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't find the answer. Anyway... The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click, etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone? I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins & electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. Maybe the communication protocol is different? Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible. In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology. Thanks, Duco --	3
Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting to get a composite sync signal on the "green"? There ought to be a little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert, and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and merges the green and composite sync together in the output. It's all 1V analog, as far as I know. I can build this with op-amps but I don't think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen. Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?	3
Micronics & AMI came out with EISA/VLB motherboards. Byte Mag tests indicate that VLB is faster for video but EISA is faster for disk ops. So I'll wait for GW2K to hopefully start using the Micronics board. --	3
I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports. Each port has the option of using IRQ 2,3,4 or 5. I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card, and the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9. From other posts I've read, I get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8-bit card is the same as IRQ9 on the multi-I/O card. Am I right?	3

I'm writing a driver that needs to remap some I/O ports. This means virtual mode. Unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along with expanded memory managers, so I need make it an EMM driver too. Does anyone out there have EMM code. Can any point me to an EMM code source? -Thanks, Morgan	3

Simple. First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be some confusion. It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt. They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. Here is an example. For some time, I was short of "free interrupts." I had a tape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7. (It's an *old* tape drive.) My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my modem is). I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously. When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port. If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller. (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would most likely "hang.") Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3. That handler won't do anything for the serial port. Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven. Instead, the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7. Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-) -- Kenneth R. Ballou VOICE: (617) 494-0990 Oberon Software, Inc.

I have a Leading edge 486sx25 with 4 Megs of RAM that are in the forms of 4 1 meg SIMMS. Each SIMM has *two* chips on it. They are manufactured by Samsung and are 80ns. A salesman told me that the leading edge CPC-2300 motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded I use MAC SIMMS. I tried using 4 Megs pulled out of a Mac SI (these are 8 chip SIMMS), but I got too many windows protection faults and parity errors. I guess I should use the same SIMMS as the ones I have, but I can't find any!! Most of the places I have called carry only 3 8 or 9 chip SIMMS. So if anybody knows where I can get memory that is good with my computer or if you have any suggestions at all, please let me know. Any help is truly appreciated. -Eric	3

(stuff deleted) My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler. This one has precision ball bearings in the motor. It has a pretty substantial heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably dissipate more heat than the bare chip. It attaches with peel off adhesive. This is a full size AT case, so the fan has gravity in its favor. I would be a little nervous about finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let go. All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable. There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple of fans mounted on them. They are powered by the slot. I don't know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment. The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit. PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day delivery. The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the power supply. PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO.	3
david@c-cat.UUCP (Dave) write: we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller. Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section: SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM. Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM. Normal {asynchronous} SCSI is 5 Mhz; fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz. Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers. Main problem: there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. SCSI-1: 8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller. asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave} and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers. 8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}. SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller. 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1. 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}. 32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit}. 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers. Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs. Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces. Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics. Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2. Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.	3
The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr. it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice. dieter	3

A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?) claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape. ^^^^^^^^^^ It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think) My question is: Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite unbelievable to me). However, any comments on the interface are appreciated. Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up if neccesary. Thanks in advance...	3
The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.	3
There's also a program called ODYSSEY (MODEM directory on the Simtel archives) that emulates MNP 4 and 5 (others, too, I think, but these were what I was interested in). I was getting a lot of garbage when I called one number, and MNP 4 cleared it up completely on my ordinary 2400 modem. (Fortunately, the remote end had an MNP modem.) I tried MNP 5, too, but it seemed to lock up the computer. Your mileage may vary.	3
As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is something like this on your board too. In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on "Setup" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to " Always" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason. -Dale	3

I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5 (the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this "cascade to IRQ8-15" business? A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about 32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus extension to do 32-bit DMA? Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode?? Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might have done wrong?	3

Hello, I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055 seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01 seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I don't like them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a possibility. So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as I'm planning on posting this to a few boards, and I don't read all of them. Thanks	3
I used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem. What was sudgested to me was to put a toriod transformer on the line. This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local electronics shop, a toroid core is a ceramic/metal "donut", and wind the telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the ouTside five or six times. This is a easy and cheap fix that does not have the hassels of having to use sofware to fix a hardware problem.	3

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17" monitors in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good reviews. I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products as well as some others that may fit the bill. I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI. I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX. Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor.

yes yes, seen glue-on, tape-on, clip-on, one-inch square and larger. my favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic U.S.Toyo fan I use just plopped down on top of the chip during open-case service. depends on the mounting only if the manufacturer was smart only if it goes out - got that "blanket" effect which doesn't help chip life longer system life makes good economic sense to me yes - well, not the melted cheese lets you touch the surface - the "rule of thumb" for cooling solid-state the "attached" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing. I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though. on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00.

If the fan should stop (burn out) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what you should be thinking about.

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB. It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may share experience on that.) Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory. So my advice is the 66/VLB. Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys). The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from 0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed (5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is lousy. The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB. Just some view, not much figures. -- Penio Penev x7423 (212)327-7423 (w) Internet: penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu	3
Ok, so I've heard about Comtrade, Gateway, TC, and various others. What about your impressions/dealings with Dell, Ariel Design, Austin, Insight, Royal, and HD computers? Responses by E-Mail are preferred because they reduce Usenet bandwidth.

In a 25-pin serial loopback plug, you need to connect the following pins: pin 1 to pin 7 pin 2 to pin 3 pins 4, 5 and 8 together pins 6, 11, 20 and 22 together pins 15, 17 and 23 together, pin 18 to pin 25. That should do it. Note that *a lot* of these pins are redundant in many implementations.... Phil	3
I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is *extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color monitors, which is a 19" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good, perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across. BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG can.	3
I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by removing the fan altogether! Two variables: 1) I always run my PC without the cover, and 2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference. Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer may save my PC... Thanks.	3
I've got a 386DX-40, 4MB and I'm using Windows 3.1. Sometimes I wondered why Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing (execpt having lunch or something like that). Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and Windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. And so I'm still wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the convertional is sufficient? Any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.	3
Hello, I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version with the DIP switches on the back). I have two problems: 1 ) I've lost the manual!!! 2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and everything works fine until I run windows, when the network connection dies. (In case it's important, the network card is an SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card. It's I/O address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is D000. It's also using IRQ 2) I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't know the Bboard number. If you can, please help me with as many of the following as possible: a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668) c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get everything working. Any help at all would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance,	3
I'm using a QIC-compatible 250MB streamer, and I really like it. But now a terrible typo in an archive description drives me mad ervery time. Is there any software which can rename, or even better, delete such archives? Any help really appreciated.	3
I hope that there's somebody out there that can help us. Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers and set it for always. What we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass or remove the password. We have tried switching bios, but to no avail. The battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries. Thanks Isak Isak Venter ITBIJV@PUKNET.PUK.AC.ZA	3
Hi peeps, Here's another of those "any ideas" type queries. I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without a keyboard. But no problem so far. When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc. Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of. The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines. The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to CGA - but useful for my laptop). Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors? I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK). DEC said sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway? A UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?" So any ideas. John.	3
I have a new monitor which I set up approximately 3-4 feet from where the AC power enters my house - at my fuse box. Is this safe for the monitor, or will/can the EMF emitted by the AC current eventually affect my monitor? If so, how, and is the damage permanent or would degaussing fix it?	3
Perry> NNTP-Posting-Host: wswiop15.win.tue.nl Perry> Perhaps you should try nic.funet.fi instead of funet.fi ??!?!? Another possibility is, that you did not give your email address as password for the anonymous account.

FOR SALE: AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer than a half-card). It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax, v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line. They will "fall back" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems. It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc). They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible. These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T. They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing. The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics, etc. The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so, as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts). I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax). This is at or below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc). And, it is backed by a company that will never go away. This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC. I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home to pick it up. (If you're concerned about installing an internal modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation.) If you're interested, please let me know. This is an excellent modem at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for about ~$300). I installed one of these last week and it is very nice. If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at (800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them. The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.	3
*** On 04-21-93 04:51, Ikos had the unmitigated gall to say this: Ik> I'm in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard Ik> disk, discovered my BIOS doesn't have a "type 47") and I would like Ik> know where I can purchase one of these things. Call Phoenix. They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips. I had to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive. Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it. The IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual size. The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in most cases. WARNING!!! Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the actual size of the drive! A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but you will be sorry if you go even one byte over. Drive damage will not result, but headaches will! ...

Article #61175 (61302 is last): From: qwerty@tunisia.ssc.gov (Kris Schludermann) Subject: HELP:IDE Drive installation problems Date: Thu Apr 22 12:11:58 1993 I'm having trouble with installing a second IDE drive on a Promise IDE caching controller. The first drive is a conner 3204 and works fine. The second drive is a conner 30174, it is currently unjumpered to be the slave drive. The problem is the slave drive is recognized but is reported back as having no free space. Disabling cache has made no effect. What else should I check for? krispy End of File, Press RETURN to quit Krispy, Lets start with what Promise controller that you have. Ther are only about 4 or 6 of them made. The one that I have the DC-99m needs nothing done but install it as stated. As to the 2th. hd you do know about running FDISK on it and partisitions and then formatting it after your finished with the fdisk operation right!....Sam	3

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this as something that was designed-in intentionally. So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA) would require an update to the chipset. An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design. What I'm saing is: The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix. In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update. This is not simple. If I were you I would be cautious about this. You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA motherboard. All slots are EISA/ISA capable. 2 (or 3) of the slots are VL-bus capable. The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA (I called them). Pentium/P5 (?) capable. Less expensive than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board. Look in Computer Shopper (April '93). The ZENON ads show the AIR mother- board. A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it. I'm attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the AIR board. Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2. You can call Motherboard Warehouse (for example) for a price. Phone #'s included below. AIR (408)-428-0800 Motherboard Warehouse (800)-486-9975	3
Stupid question from a new IBM PC user: I'm going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000. What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD? The GW 486DX-33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive. I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive. The guy asked me "Why are you going with SCSI?". I was lost for an answer. I just said "I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point of view". Are SCSI drives faster than IDE? I'm not buying my GW for another 4 months or so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.	3

.. actually from Alistair Scott afs@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au I have come across a old external hard disk and I can't find any specs for it anywhere... It is made by NEC (yes I tried tech support.... no help), and it has a model number APC-H27C and is labelled "Expansion Hard Disk" Can anyone help me out with figuring out what this beast is. The external connector looks like a scsi plug, and the date on the drive chassis is 1984... os it's pretty old. I just want to see what it is, before I deep six it or rip it apart for bits. thanks	3

OK. Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions). These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable). If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want. The price for each issue is shown beside each comic. First come, first served!!! There is no more bidding. Meet my price and it is yours. I can be reached at this email address: 02106@chopin.udel.edu or 02106@ravel.udel.edu or 02106@bach.udel.edu or 02106@brahms.udel.edu NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!! Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics. For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

It's just that the few bad ones are what get all the publicity. Agreed. I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net and I have bought things from CDs (plenty!) to a full computer. The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than the seller. Besides, complaints are always what get the publicity....when something goes wrong, people complain. Rarely have I seen posts stating how well a deal went through. I guess Kevin is practically a first!	6

[ ... Useful info about the Maxtor drive deleted ... ] However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'. Also note the strange cross-posting (as he probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends to mount it on. If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the "2C" jumper would be the correct choice. I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-) DoN.	6

I still have about 70 records left on hand, all in pristine condition (except where noted), quite a few out-of-print and more than a few imports in the bunch. Rather than selling the majority for $3-4 each, I'm looking to barter packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET. I'll also trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced with CD, as well as pre-recorded videos on Beta or VHS. In the past, I've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list/store price (e.g., 1 CD = 1 movie in Beta format*) to get around what you or I might have originally paid (as if we can even remember! (-;) ** [At this time, I'm looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable batteries ... if you have some lying around, and they're sound, RSVP!] So if you're curious, RSVP for my list and if you see anything that you like, send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of your ad for the stuff you're selling ... thanks! gld * i.e., the imports and out-of-prints are also valued at 1 used CD; ** I once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records (list $81); Anybody got a nice, unused blender for making frozen margaritas? (-; PS: There have been NO additions since the last posting in February; the list has only shrunk as I've made a few deals since.	6

I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale. I purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. We didn't have the time to sell the shirts. I have about 175 shirts left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts, even in bulk) (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts) These shirts are Jim Morris T-shirts. They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4 colors. (They are clean and neatly folded in a box. If any happen to be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace it, your option.) You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece (the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school event or a organization. I realize it is a big investment, but it could pay off big. I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a shirt. I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them more bargaining power. Please help me. I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need the money. I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap. I will give you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices. All prices are negotiable. --Truman	6

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping included. WinSong for Windows: Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one. It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition. It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder. Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward and stop. It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set, saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many. You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and stifling aspect.	6

Held my whole 2-1/4 Bronica system, Metz flash, etc. Main chamber (not incl lid and pockets) is 18.5"W x 9"H x 7" D. Very strong bag, good for medium format users or videographers. 2.

It's basement cleaning time. This stuff has got to go. I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box. They are free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up. They've seen very little use. If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee. I have a lot of serial cables. I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long, short M-M, M-F whatever you want. Most appear to work well with PC serial ports, but I will not gaurantee that. Tell me what you want and I'll do the best I can to match. 1.50 ea or 10/$10. Shipping included. No CODs under $20. (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable? Go buy the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.) I believe these cables were removed from service at a computer center. They appear to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well. I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably a logic board. It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high. I think they used to run a Prime system off of it. Best offer over $75, but you need to come pick it up. Use this to run your house from your solar panels. I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.	6

<><><><> L O O K I N G F O R D A N A W E I C K <><><><> HE IS A CROOK. DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please Help: I am looking for Dana Weick. A month ago I made a deal with him over the net. I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu. I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it. I sent him the memory COD FOR $100. He was then suppose to send me the cpu. I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93. He send me a message the he sent the cpu out 4/16/93. It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU. I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.) He never reply my mail. I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona. The first call didn't get throught, I got an answering machine. I left him my number. He didn't reply. I call again the next day and he pick up the phone. I asked him if he had send out the cpu. He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it to. He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day. To my suprise, He never called. I then send him some more email messages, he never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.) Now: I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone. I am also still emailing him, but he won't reply my mail. So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him. he can be reach at: Dana Weick 4238 W Las Palmaritas Phoenix, AZ 85051 (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number. (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number. his email address is: weick@master.lds-az.loral.com *******This is our deal From weick@master.lds-az.loral.com Wed Mar 17 20:09:20 1993 [my address] Great, you can send the SIMMS to me at: Dana Weick 4238 W Las Palmaritas Phoenix, AZ 85051 (602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings) I would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90) The CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in backwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months. Thanks ****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID... that I got the cod payment. and asked if the cpu is sent out yet ****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9 Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out for it. Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge, bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you plug the chip in the proper orientation. The chip was checked out prior to shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real sympathetic! If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, DON'T GUESS! ********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:**************************** I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone. She said that he was busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets. Half an house went by, Weick didn't called. I called him again, and his phone was discon- nected. Since this post, I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA WEICK have ripped them off. We got do something about this guy. He has appearrently been doing this for a few years now. And he is getting away with it. --	6

Hi All I have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping. For those who've not had the pleasure: It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice processor. What can it do with your voice? It can pitch-shift it (change the notes you sing). It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one time). It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what you say alone and intelligible. This works well for a "computerized" sounding singer, or robot voice. For those of you who just thought about that, yes - you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes - I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically. For an input, it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables. For output, you can have a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired). It has preset setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences. It has a couple of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly. Even when we don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio. The manual is included. I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.	6

I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two, but one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for $30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the base configuration, depending on what you want: - 386 16 MHZ CPU. - 8 meg of ram. - Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)! - A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports! - Ethernet. - 5.25" floppy drive. - QIC 24 cartridge tape drive. - 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want). - Unix System V.3 installation. - Networking software package (TCP/IP). - Development system software package (C compiler and libraries). I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or serial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of three ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive. This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users. This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's very fast and exceptionally reliable. It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep. I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up. Shipping is way too much hassle. Call if you wish, or send email.

Article 31 of alt.graphics: Newsgroups: alt.graphics Path: news.nd.edu!moliere!rmalayte From: rmalayte@moliere.helios.nd.edu (ryan malayter) Subject: GeoSphere images via ftp? Message-ID: <1993Apr26.213648.26856@news.nd.edu> Sender: news@news.nd.edu (USENET News System) Organization: University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame Date: Mon, 26 Apr 1993 21:36:48 GMT Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is available via ftp? For those of you who don't know, it is a composite photograph of the entire earth, with cloudcover removed. I just think it's really cool. It was created with government funds and sattelites as a research project, so I would assume it's in the public domain. Thanks for any info, Ryan	1
I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures? What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen. I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through. Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also. It's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway. But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better.	1
G'Day All, I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM. I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also. I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer... Any help would be apprieciated! cheers Stephen.	1

From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person. I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such. Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10". (This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".) The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage: :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person capable of appreciating {hack value}. 4. A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence 'password hacker', 'network hacker'. See {cracker}. The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net (see {network, the} and {Internet address}). It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see {hacker ethic, the}). It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled {bogus}). See also {wannabee}. :hacker ethic, the: n. 1. The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible. 2. The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality. Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and giving away free software. A few go further and assert that *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU} project. Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering. But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}). On this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop, preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}. The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing resources with other hackers. Huge cooperative networks such as {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address}) can function without central control because of this trait; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset. : Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is : a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-) Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so. There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'. So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace. (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.) Sometimes, there may only be one such person. : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. : Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-) Language works anyway that we want it to work. The purpose of language is to communicate. To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place, then language is working.	1
First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well. I suggest that the weakness is your reference material. Get "An Introduction to Ray Tracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm. You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam. On to the question. The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity. For example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^). So, you get some illumination equation like this: I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity, as is the light due to transparency. Now, a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this: I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt. So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a purple-colored glass object. Hopefully this answers your question. I'll forward my "illumination equation sermon" to you also.	1
I am revamping some computer-aided visual inspection systems which use the old AT&T Targa-16 Board Set (2 cards) to display images from a color CCD camera to a color monitor, providing the option to overlay text or a crosshair. No image capture or manipulation is performed, just display. I would like to know if there is still a source for development libraries which would allow me to embed commands in my own software to enable the camera, draw crosshairs, print text, etc. I'll be glad to pay if they are commercially available. E-Mail if possible. -- ---------------------------------------------------------------- Joe Ryburn | CIM Manager | Intergraph Corporation | Manufacturing Integration | Huntsville, AL 35894	1

Never claimed it is a bug. Never claimed it is a bug. I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups. I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images. Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image, we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations. Never claimed it is a bug. I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is. (You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many places so far.) You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.	1
Hello, We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system (a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2). This graphics package must support a wide variety of character based graphics devices (PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily). At this point, X11 graphics is not an option. This graphics program should, if possible, support these sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements): 1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.) Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc. 2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color plotting were available, if the output device supported it. We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but gnuplot has some limitations. We are looking for something more robust than gnuplot. At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that might solve our problems. If you have any information, please contact me at the above email address. If the product you know about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.	1
can someone tell me where i could find ansi or ascii pics? I already found the gopher ascii pics. thanks Richard Mancsuo	1
Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary. If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially printing. Chuck	1
I was wondering if anyone has ever seen/heard of a utility that converts any type of image format (gif,tiff,pcx,bmp,jpeg,etc.) to an ascii representation. I have seen some very sophiticated art in ascii format, but never was I able to find the author or any program that may have converted the data from a picture format. Any help or leads would be great. Thanks in advance. Danny Dunlavy	1
I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to- call-it a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was going to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.) Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this, Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun. Other than the articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't heard a peep about it. I hope it's still in the works.	1
I'm having a slight problem with the POV raytracer. I'm not sure if this is the correct group to post to or not. I create .tga files on a unix machine using pov. Then when i download them to display on my pc, they're listed as bad files. But when I create the file on my pc, it displays fine. Are unix .tga's incompatible with the pc? An easy solution to this problem would be a unix targa->gif converter. Anyone know where I could find one? Any help on this subject is appreciated.	1
How about the GNU people, handing out very good, free software? I've also distributed two decent-sized programs myself, the Go player Fumiko (at ftp.u.washington.edu) and the Genetic Neural Network Programmer CEREBRUM (somewhere out there).

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*. It is not a picture file format, sound file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard. The IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM). The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and it's predecessor, Turbo Silver. It is possible that some of the other Amiga packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any. Lightwave will load TDDD FORM's I believe.	1

I think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er) Gates' and Jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a phenomenom as it is now. With the increased popularity of the PC come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical minded and narrower-focused programmers. Why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or programs for accountants? Basically, the yuppies caught up and disciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image.	1
Hi. I'm looking for information on how to directly manipulate video memory. I have an application that I would like to use this for, because it is much faster than going through the BIOS.

How can one dump to the printer, the content of a VGA screen. If it were a text screen, we can execute a shift printscr. but with graphics, we have to do a pixed by pixel print. It would be greatly appreciated if someone can supply source code for this. Alternately, are there commercial or shareware programs that are available to do this. I must be able to shell out of my program to execute this print screen. Therefore, it would be prefferable to have source code.

[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ] I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most obvious thing. Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument, please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written. It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method and don't understand include previously written material with the new sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such. You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know that you have not read my article carefully in the first place. XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or? Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives; I allready mailed one to Bradley...	1
Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few important parameters. The polygons are all convex. They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.) I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons. This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier. The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made. Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons. It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms. If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.	1
If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4 at least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is implied. Conversations proceed much like: Zaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder? Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number. Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and everytime it's arranged such that "Think of a number, any number" could be an answer to someone's question about the Question. I kind of like it. Very mystifying. It's not even "pick a number" or "tell me a number", just "think of one".	1

I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations. I can't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation). I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex. The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish. If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it. (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.) The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas. The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area. Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid. Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines. The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines. The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines. This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas. This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias. I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching. But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range. (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.) It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning! This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind. I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree. The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1. Open questions: (1) Why does this happen? -- Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly? -- Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which could be corrected for? -- Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their interpolators? -- Something else? (2) What to do about it? -- Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in Z-buffered HLHSR? -- Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching artifacts? -- Am I just out of luck? Any help would be immensely appreciated!	1
Hello, Thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of displaying 24 bit images. All the viewers like xli, xloadimage and display are converting the 24 bit images to 8 bit before display them on the screen. What I really want is a viewer with make use of the 24 bit frame/screen buffer (in our case, the Parallax one). Thanks in advance. Gilles	1

This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a client and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained as described below. Once you have a gopher client point it at merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space! Dan Jacobson danj@welchgate.welch.jhu.edu ----- Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a client/server protocol for making a world wide information service, with many implementations. Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks. The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or via anonymous ftp: rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find out how to do FTP by e-mail. ------------------------------------------------------------------- List of questions in the Gopher FAQ: Q0: What is Gopher? Q1: Where can I get Gopher software? Q2: What do I need to access Gopher? Q3: Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher? Q4: Who Develops Gopher Software? Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? Q7: What is veronica? Q8: What is Available for Biology? ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q0: What is Gopher? A0: The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed. While providing a delivery vehicle for local information, Gopher facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers throughout the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1: Where can I get Gopher software? A1: via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu. Look in the directory /pub/gopher -------------------------------------------------------------------- Q2: What do I need to access Gopher? A2: You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC or workstation There are clients for the following systems. The directory following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory /pub/gopher. Unix Curses & Emacs : /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z Xwindows (athena) : /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z Xwindows (Motif) : /pub/gopher/Unix/moog Xwindows (Xview) : /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher Macintosh Hypercard : /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions * Macintosh Application : /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher * DOS w/Clarkson Driver : /pub/gopher/PC_client/ NeXTstep : /pub/gopher/NeXT/ VM/CMS : /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/ VMS : /pub/gopher/VMS/ OS/2 2.0 : /pub/gopher/os2/ MVS/XA : /pub/gopher/mvs/ Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the following is an attempt at a comprehensive list. A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book" sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher". ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh * Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp". ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp * A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace for DOS lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP. Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client itself. Put the following on a gopher server: Type=1 Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu Port=70 Path= Name=Gopher Software Distribution. Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and look in the gopher directory. There are also a number of public telnet login sites available. The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more information about this. It is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites. A client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.) A local client is also faster. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3: Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher? A3: Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize network lag. Telnet Public Logins: Hostname IP# Login Area ------------------------- --------------- ------ ------------- consultant.micro.umn.edu 134.84.132.4 gopher North America gopher.uiuc.edu 128.174.33.160 gopher North America panda.uiowa.edu 128.255.40.201 panda North America gopher.sunet.se 192.36.125.2 gopher Europe info.anu.edu.au 150.203.84.20 info Australia gopher.chalmers.se 129.16.221.40 gopher Sweden tolten.puc.cl 146.155.1.16 gopher South America ecnet.ec 157.100.45.2 gopher Ecuador gan.ncc.go.jp 160.190.10.1 gopher Japan It is recommended that you run the client software instead of logging into the public login sites. A client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.) and gives faster response. Furthermore many of the basic features of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4: Who Develops Gopher Software? A4: Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help our campus find answers to their computer questions. It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information System used by a large number of sites in the world. Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to count. The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail: Internet Gopher Developers 100 Union St. SE #190 Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA Or via FAX at: +1 (612) 625-6817 --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)? A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems. As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: - Search local WAIS indices. - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher clients. - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher clients. - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using built in gopher querying or using native http querying. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available? A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in : _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note: ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!) _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online" By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica: Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized Archives. veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles in the entire gopher web. As archie is to ftp archives, veronica is to gopherspace. A veronica search produces a menu of gopher items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source. Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the gopher protocol. To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at: Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) Type=1 Port=70 Path=1/veronica Host=futique.scs.unr.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Q8: What is Available for Biology?

well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering them. as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible? scanning and altering is no big deal. i don't know what types of features you have in your version of photoshop. but the one i use (which, incidentally is on a quadra) has gallery effects and all types of other neato stuff. i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into negatives, because once you print the image out-that's your print. do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this? like, are you doing this just for fun, for a business, to gain more computer knowledge, for a project you're working on.... otherwise, i guess i don't know if i'd be helping or not by posting info on scanning and stuff. ok? cool. seeya	1
Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need a mapping icon per applied texture. I want to use a special purpose graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the mapping rule. Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally unsuitable for my needs. Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a PC? I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this must be saved in a file which I can read. I haven't found any info on Alias in the copy of the faq that I have.	1

I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library package to do PC VGA graphics. I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics. I'm not sure if reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not. I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time. If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library. Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something, what do you think?	1
I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old. Some screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy". This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just unlucky! Regards, Kate. :)|	1

: I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a : 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system. I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or : something akin to that. Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel. That's : 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for? Specifically the 48-bit color? That's 280 : trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve. Is this an anti-aliasing thing? Or : is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor. I'm pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as 96 bits of color info. Why? Why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the hardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers demand professional results. : Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products? I know of : Iris, Indigo, and Crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line? : (sadly, I have access to none of them. Just a DEC 5000/25. Sigh.) Strange question, but anyway, there's the VGX line, the newer Indigo^2, and the Onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of a reality engine). There's more, but I don't have my handy "periodic table of sgi's" on me...	1
Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw. I personally like Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa. I haven't found the perfect graphics program that does everything yet. My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different formats. Arts & Letters does not. I like the thousands of clipart available with Arts & Letters. However, I do find looking them up in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying. One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on the market for the artistically deprived :-).	1

Which newsgroup discusses graphic design on PCs and macs?	1
I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that will do compositing of a series of pictures? What I mean by "compositing" is, say I have a live video clip (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated bird flying around the screen. I want to combine these two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want the living room picture to show through. Yes, I realize I can do this with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do manual compositing also. It's ok if I have to composite one frame at a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway. But being able to composite a series of frames would be even better. I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform this. Help, please! If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do this for you. It can take one animation, make a certain color "clear", and overlay it over another animation. I do not have a way right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files. Animator will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work.	1

I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file format. I was looking thru it, but I didn't get the idea how to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the whole image. How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF? How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale picture? I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing the header chunks. The output looks like this: 157605 bla.gif 640x 480 248C24 I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this: 57605 bla.jpg 640x 480 C24 Please respond by email, because I don't read this news group very often. I'll post a summary if it is useful. Thanx in advance, Larry	1

I was hoping for something along the lines of AAWIN or AAPLAY by Autodesk but for the creation of these delta compressed animations. I have FLILIB but this seems to be coded for the Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C. Ideally I would like a DLL or Medium model object library, but would settle for anything, really. I've seen other Windows apps with FLI/FLC creation, did they hack the FLILIB code into submission? Any pointers would be appreciated, please send mail directly to me and I will summarize the results if there is interest.	1
Maybe. I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it has (and ever has had) is the "arm" of the screen is sorta lose and if you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it round a bit. But other than that, it's been perfect! So what's that, about um, 60 months???!	1
Can I view JPEG files without special hardware?	1
I have a very large (3x5 feet) file in Macintosh Canvas v2.something which I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least disk-space intensive way possible. (i.e. EPS is a big problem, since it took 1.3 MEG to encode one page of the document) The file is entirely lines and words. I have access to networked Macs & PC's, and ftp. Can anyone suggest how this might be accomplished? Email replies, if you would, I don't read this group much. Thanks in advance.	1
On a more cheerful note, perhaps hackerism/hacking isn't completely dead. As someone else said, take the GNU offerings for example - free, redistributable and often better than the commercial stuff. Take also the number of papers published every year in all the fields of computer science - the vast majority of these papers detail original work of real, often exceptional merit - and the authors are sharing this knowledge.	1
What is the copyright status of this data? Are there restrictions regarding the uses they can be put to? Kaveh	1
I am looking for the specs for the .mpg files that are floating around the alt.binaries.pictures.* groups on the net. Please lemme know where I can obtain the spec or email it to me. Thanks much.	1

If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica, Maple,... I would like to ask you for the solution to the following problem. I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified symbolic solution. Is there a FTP-able package out there that can handle such beasts? I would like to solve the following ray - Bezier patch intersection for the scalar constant t in: P + t * V = Q(u,w) (origin point in 3D) (dir vector 3D) in terms of only: P V P and various scalars (origin) , (dir 3D) , (i,j) 0 <= i,j <= 3 where: T Q(u,w) = [U] [N] [B] [M] [W] n n-1 n-2 n-3 [U] = [ u u u u .... u 1 ] ( 0.0 <= u <= 1.0 ) 3 2 = [ u u u 1 ] ( in my particular case ) n n-1 n-2 n-3 T [W] = [ w w w w .... w 1 ] ( 0.0 <= w <= 1.0 ) 3 2 T = [ w w w 1 ] ( in my particular case ) T [ N ] = [ M ] = | -1 3 -3 1 | ( for my particular case ) | 3 -6 3 0 | | -3 3 0 0 | | 1 0 0 0 | [ B ] = | P P P P | (control points in 3D space) | (0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) | | | | P P P P | | (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) | | | | P P P P | | (2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) | | | | P P P P | | (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) | Thanx,	1
Does anyone know of a program for the PC that will take AutoCad DXF format files and convert them to a raster format, like PCX, GIF, etc? Thanks in advance.... ED	1
Does anyone know of any c or c++ libraries for preparing and displaying quickly pages of mixed text, mathematical equations, and graphics (circles,ellipses,etc) on the vdu? The maths wouldnt need to be up to TeX quality, but it would be useful to be scaleable. The main thing would be to be able to generate the display quickly from a minimum set of formatting code. Thanks, Ed Campbell	1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling, but not both simultaneously? ^^ Same question again, does this mean they can either do double buffering or stereo, but not both simultaneously? --	1
How can I find these files and graphics that people are downloading from their Unix systems? Then, how do I download them? I am a complete beginner in this (obviously), so please baby-step me through the process. First of all, I don't see amongst these newsgroups where there is anything remotely like a GIF, TIF, or compiled shareware program? Thanks in advance for any information you can give me. (I know there is a Unix command, "ftp," that will allow me to do this, but first I need to know where to go to find the file I want download via ftp, etc. Thomas Helke egret@wet.UUCP	1
Archive-name: graphics/resources-list/part2 Last-modified: 1993/04/27 Computer Graphics Resource Listing : WEEKLY POSTING [ PART 2/3 ] =================================================== Last Change : 27 April 1993 14.

Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers and is easily extensible to include new devices. It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches. You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!). The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot. Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr) ----------------------- Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr. Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1 and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x. Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version) /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version) Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu). Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between. Robot ----- Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator). Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28), pub/astrod. VG plotting library ------------------- This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov [129.6.64.151] Xgobi ----- It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge from STATLIB at CMU. To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and in the body area of the message, put the line send xgobi from general If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as "statlib" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type cd general mget xgobi.* Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the relevant README to decide whether you need it or not. PGPLOT ------ Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX.

Despite its small size and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph. Different line styles, widths and colors are supported. A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used. There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set. This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols. The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects. Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile format and renderer. Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems: Unix: SunOS, A/IX, HP-UX, Unicos, DG/UX, Ultrix Other platforms: VMS, Amiga/Exec, MS-DOS, OS/2, NeXT Authors: Many.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ========================================================== PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ====================== IMDISP ------ IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display, enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions [PC and Macs] LabVIEW 2 --------- LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements. Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram (program). Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc. The tool allows any Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument. National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP) boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer. New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software. There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW: Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300. Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware. This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use. Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for the development of custom code.) Ultimage Concept VI ------------------- Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems. A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography, surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging, electronic microscopy and remote sensing. Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis. It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and characterization. The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane. Standard input and output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD. Other formats can be imported. Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic operations, and geometric transformations, among others. Morphological transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others. Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and morphological distribution. Measures include area, perimeter, center of gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and shape factors and equivalence. Measures are saved in ASCII format. The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules. A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc. There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity. These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines. The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude) data. The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts. The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even hole filling. The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area, perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points. GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494 707-579-1733 IPLab Spectrum -------------- IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI. Using scripting tools, the user tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a movie command for cycling through windows. Macintosh-based tools ===================== NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more --------------------------------- NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results from numerical modelling calculations. These applications, documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been developed by Spyglass. Spyglass, Inc. 701 Devonshire Drive Champaign, IL 61820 (217) 355-6000 fax: 217 355 8925 NIH IMAGE --------- Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably) zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image. It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language, tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel, though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version from zippy.nimh.nih.gov) PhotoMac -------- Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700 PhotoPress ---------- Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973 PixelTools and TCL-Image ------------------------ "Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications software) for scientific image processing and analysis. Video-rate capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution monochromatic and color images. Includes C source code." TCL-Image: "Software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement, and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images. TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm development -- variables and control structures. It is easily extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. These script files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands. They are executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters. The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame grabber boards. TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF." Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200 Satellite Image Workshop ------------------------ It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co- processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1 In the documentation the contact address is given as: Liz Smith, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MS 300-323, 4800 Oak Grove Dr,.Pasadena, CA 91109 (818) 354-6980 Visualization Workbench ----------------------- "An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting." Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112 Adobe Photoshop --------------- The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey scale. Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS applications. These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush. Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated. For example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%, allowing you to create ghost overlays. RPhoto-editingS tools include control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation modification and spectrum equalization. Images can be subjected to various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image, blur edges, or locate edges. Image scaling is also supported. For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG, availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF, EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint, PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan.. Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA 94039-7900 415-961-4400 ColorStudio and ImageStudio --------------------------- ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and therefore more difficult to use. Several steps are often required to accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop. The application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can easily end up with images in the 30 MB range. The program provides a variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool" which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close hues, color range and mask. ImageStudio: Don't know... Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100 Dapple Systems -------------- "High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of global or feature parameters, and interpret the data." Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283 Digital Darkroom ---------------- The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide selections. A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool. This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale images only. It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio. Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA 92126 619-695-6956 Dimple ------ It is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching tool and it is very good for this purpose." "Dimple runs on a colour Macintosh. It is a product still in its development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of other packages, but is coming along nicely. It has its own inbuilt language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down menus etc... It is unprotected software." Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757 Fax 61 42 264190. Enhance ------- Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc. Files can be saved as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported). MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA 50322 515-270-8109 Image Analyst ------------- An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images. Image Analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language. It is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs. Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically. Image Analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or a disk-stored image. Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image. Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images. Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and position. The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices. There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user defines. Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI) represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image. Inside a ROI, the program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape, the thickness of a wall, etc. Image Analyst finds the center, edge and other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good starter program except for the obtuse manual" IMAGINE-32 ---------- It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called "Imagine32" or "Image32" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add, subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image. It can also display a number of images simultaneously. The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. PC Vista -------- It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP. It is known to be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been richmond@bllac.berkeley.edu richmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu and his s-mail address is: Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code, you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work, but will require substantial modifications.

SOFTWARE TOOLS -------------- It's a set of software "tools" put out by Canyon State Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber software. MIRAGE ------ It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms. It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image processing displaying functions built in. DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ---------------------------- The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers. Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it. MAXEN386 -------- A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92 (an article on CCD's vs film). JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA) ------------------------ Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific. Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640, (800) 874-1888. Microbrian ---------- Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of super VGA cards. Its a full blown remote sensed data processing system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle. Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is marketed/ supported by: MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria tel + 61 3 724 4488 fax +61 3 724 4455) There are educational and commercial prices, but be prepared to set aside $A10k for the first educational licence.

Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details. Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical image community. They issue a newsletter also. They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells. It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows. Very flexible/extendable -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer. ALV --- A Sun-specific image toolkit. Version 2.0.6 posted to comp.sources.sun on 11dec89. Also available via email to alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk. AIPS ---- Astronomical Image Processing System. Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits) Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville, VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV). Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT, or (non-anonymous) internet ftp. Documentation (PostScript mostly) available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103), directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL. Installation requires building the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler. This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a synthesis instrument. It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy. There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based graphics tool built into AIPS. The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and can do image arithmetic, etc. The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI. There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an object oriented approach. Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and Australia to name a few. LABOimage --------- (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView. The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp. It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), medicine, biology, physics. It is distributed free of charge (source code).

Email to vista@lowell.edu for more details. Total size less than 20Mbytes. DISIMP ------ (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in interactive times. Feature Description DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules. Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and ratioing. Host Configuration Requirements Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times. DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific applications programs. Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables, colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control. A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery. The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of remote sensed data.

Telephone: +61 3 825 5555 Fax: +61 3 826 6463 Global Imaging Software ----------------------- "We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass, automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically and carefree. It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that difficult to write your own with their programmer's module. Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy. Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX. Supports 24-bit display" HIPS ---- (Human Information Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil exploration, etc.). It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images. It has been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library. Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research, system development and teaching. It handles sequences of images (movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames. Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform processing, edge detection and line drawing manipulation, digital image compression and transmission methods, noise generation, and image statistics computation. Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed. As a result, almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines. New users become effective using HIPS on their first day. HIPS features images that are self-documenting. Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image. HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header, and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX ``filters''. It comes complete with source code, on-line manual pages, and on-line documentation. Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University, HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available. It runs under the UNIX operating system. It is modular and flexible, provides automatic documentation of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment. HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax, Sun, Apollo, Masscomp, NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc. For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and Sun-386i consoles. We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata, Macintosh II, X windowing system, and Iris). The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS-4000. It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max- Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98% of HIPS is machine independent. Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system, both as an interactive research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or Sun cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ] MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis. MIRA gives workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware. The entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations. Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse. There are also smooth, real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other palettes can be generated. Supported functions include such niceties as the following: o image & image: + - / * interpolation o image & constant: + - / * o unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log, byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient, line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel. Ellipse, rectangle, line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to any specified angle. o CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to region target mean, median, or modal value. o create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image, collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of region of an image. o review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot keyword values for a set of images. o luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry, brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical aperture shape to image isophotes. o interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,` centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times, change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function or histogram equalization. o interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for registration. o interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or 2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting, point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars) to file or printer. Change to user specified coordinate system. o Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.) o Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations. I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer). This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range. In those terms it doesn't seem so bad. What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe. So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip. Ditto with lines. When you start/end at different x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect. You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices. You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap. Example: Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100) Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100) Your implementation is correct. In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines. Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say. When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it. This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo! (Note to IBM'ers: The information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)	1
I have a group of GIF images that each contain 6 small images in the same place on all the images. I need a program to crop out the small images to a new GIF file. All the programs I can find make me use the mouse or keyboard to define the cropping coordinates. Is there a program out there for a PC that can take the crop coordinates on the command line?	1
CALL FOR PAPERS =============== Progress In Neural Networks Special Volume on Shape Analysis Omid M. Omidvar Minsoo Suk Series Editor Volume Editor Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning a special volume on "Shape Analysis", scheduled for this year. This volume will be a part of "Progress in Neural Networks," an annual book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and application of neural networks.

I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary, it was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms. NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections, NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections. I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement it. If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.	1
Howdy... I think you would be interested in Infini-D 2.5 for the Mac. There is no DOS or Windows version. It's quite an amazing program. "Some" of the features: * Bevel Text * Timeline based animation sequencer * Realtime bounding box preview * Object linking * Phong Shading * Ray Tracing * Bounding Box shading * Wireframe shading * Ghourad shading * Flat shading * Anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high) * Environment maps * Quicktime support (wrap a QT movie around an object) * Procedural surfaces * Composed surfaces (for layering surfaces) * Alpha channel support * Import EPS, DXF, and Swivel 3D files * Export DXF and Swivel 3D files * Spline based animation * Animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff) * Object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too) ... And lots more that I can't remember right now... Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering packages. I think you can get it for around $699 from MacWarehouse. They also have educational discounts... Well, hope that helps a bit. See ya...	1
: Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If this just means that I : need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the : "death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually : happened. I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the : net about this because I already know what they'll say: "Yep, you gotta have : this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???." : I've only had the computer for about 21 months. "Only"?!? That's a long time! (echoing above posting) The way the market is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it. Sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but that's sometimes necessary for equipment. : Is that a reasonable life : cycle for a LCD display? I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable. If you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot point, perhaps. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- sandy santra _\/_ trevor@netcom.com berkeley, california /\ trevor@well.sf.ca.us	1

I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22. After fixing up a few bugs (3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of other things) I got it to compile & link, but after starting client & server I just get a black window; sometimes the client core dumps, sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the cursor to become a cross-hair in dog-fight, but that's it. I've sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but no reply as yet.	1
We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated and ones that will give prettier images. Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are going to present a paper titled "Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains" which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator. We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, and terrain elevation maps (DTM). Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases. If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us directly : amit@math.tau.ac.il (Amit Shaked), or danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)	1

As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse. A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question. On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live. The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities. Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest. E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job. At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed, and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail and by other means. Sincerely yours,	1
What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's hardware. I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple, DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's hardware. Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and cheaper than the one they just bought. When I used to be a Sun customer years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386 and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along. What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM. Why? I have no idea. Either IBM really does take care of their customers better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the smaller vendors do.	1

I was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at NIH with a database that included images in .GIF format. While I have not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call an X viewer, I figure that the majority of the users here are not in an X11 environment - instead using DOS and MS-Kermit. With Kermit supporting Tek4010 emulation for graphics display, does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a .GIF image? It would be of more use to the local population to plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of XView or XLoadImage ...	1
Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out! The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery! For example: SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same thing, a 127% increase. Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite, which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially. TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate. Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings, these are now an extra cost option. Bundling that back into the basic rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost. SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership. Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee. What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services. But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big. But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year. Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am? ________________________________________________________________________________ Robert Reed Home Animation Ltd. 503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com 5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068 SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS	1

FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24 in Orlando, Florida. The conference was organized by the Rensse- laer Design Research Center in co-operation with IEEE and SIG- GRAPH. Attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents. A good cross-section of the PHIGS community was represented at this conference with participants including PHIGS users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan- dards committee members, and researchers from industry and academia. The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS users to "take charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS implementors. The closing speaker, Dr. Andries Van Dam, described his vision of the future of graphics standards "beyond PHIGS". Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics: PHIGS and X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues, Texture Mapping, NURBS, PHIGS Extensions, and Object-Oriented Libraries and Frameworks. Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using PHIGS, and Portability Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences. The conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3D graphics to object-oriented tools based on PHIGS. Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994. PHIGS EVERYWHERE At the conference, PHIGS vendors described and demonstrated PHIGS products that run on all types of computers, from PCs to mainframes. Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing and translucency. Template Graphics Software launched FIGARO+ PRO, the Photo- Realistic Option for PHIGS+. FIGARO+ PRO is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like ray tracing, materials, anti-aliasing and texture mapping. Radiosity support is also planned. FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products. FIGARO+ supports immediate mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL, HP Starbase and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer. TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a powerful "2-call" charting system based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object- oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers. G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS on Silicon Graphics workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver- sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's PHIGS+ library for worksta- tions, will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS internal state. G5G also described their Non-Duplicated Data Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS CSS for more efficient use of memory. In addition, G5G described their application GSE that allows application callback functions during GPHIGS traversal. GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual- izer and application development toolkit, are currently available on all major workstations that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or Starbase. Wise Software presented a slide show of Z-PHIGS for MS-Windows and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most of the PHIGS+ primitives. In addition Z-PHIGS has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera- tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of Z-PHIGS or ARENA is available on request. ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS implemen- tation based on DEC PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor- porates PEX support. Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital Equipment Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS. DEC PHIGS V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with support for PEX V5.1 protocol. DEC PHIGS also contains most GM/EDS PHIGS extensions including post-to-view as well as proprietary extensions to support immediate mode rendering and the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment. AXP, DEC, and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Cor- poration. GRAFPAK-PHIGS and ATC are trademarks of Advanced Tech- nology Center. PEX and X11 are trademarks of Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340 workstation running graPHIGS and PEX. Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A Hewlett Packard machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest PHIGS product enhance- ments.

Hello, I have some problem in converting tga file(generated by POVray) to rle file. When I convert, I do not get any warning message. But if I use xloadimage/getx11, something is wrong. Error messages are, % targatorle -o o.rle data.tga % xloadimage o.rle o.rle is a 0x0 24 bit RLE image with no map (will dither to 8 bits), with gamma of 1.00 Dithering image...done Building XImage...done xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0 xloadimage: X Error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter) on 0xb00003 ...... I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat | rawtorle | rleflip ) Does any body out there have same experience/problems ? Thanks in advance,	1
PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API's for the PEX protocol, which is an extension to the X protocol. So it depends on You, what you go to use. Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs, SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects. Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for immediate mode graphics, because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs to a Prortocol. -- \|/ (o o) -oOO--(_)--OOo-------------------------------------------------------- \\ Roland Holzapfel Computer email: // \\ Wilhelminenstrasse 7 Graphics holzapfe@igd.fhg.de // // 6100 Darmstadt Center phone: \\ // Germany (ZGDV) ++49 6151 155150 \\ ----------------------------------------------------------------------- >> This space intentionally left blank <<	1
Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly? Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries. You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd. So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds: In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves. As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If that was not what you meant, then: Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry if I misunderstood. Yes again.

I heard a friend who just return from NAB from Las Vegas confirm that RealSoft will be releasing a Windows version of REAL-3D 2.0 this summer. He was told that the rendering speed on the DX50 isn't as fast as A4000. However, he was also told that they are switching from Microsoft C++ to Watcom to gain more speed. For people who is looking for a powerful 3D animation software for PC. The wait shouldn't be too long. Real 3D 2.0 is absolutely the most powerful and flexible 3D package out there that sells for less than $1000.	1

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes: 1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official' hierarchies 2.

I don't know the answer the to this one, although with 8-bits I would assume that it was one or the other. According to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you can have double buffered stereo output.	1
I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I would like to automate the procedure. The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the public domain? If so, where?	1

Dear Netters: I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists public domain source code for this. Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used (M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversion using a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65). But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ? I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed this is already the case. I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden line removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to make sure ? Any pointers are welcome ?

Hi! We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps something else ? The question is, where can I find some information about this language ? A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ? (OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT optimistic...) Thanks in advance for any help! jussi	1

RFD Request For Discussion for the OPEN TELEMATIC GROUP OTG I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards. These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG, FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications. We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 platforms. It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations, Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor. This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not delay joining if you are a developer An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject. If you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the address below. This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter as well as a hardcopy version. We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor. NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone lines/LAN.

My 24-bit color 600 dpi fladbed scanner can do the job for you. GIF, TIFF, PCX, BMP. Interested? Please write to me: imagesyz@aol.com	1
amen.. I too have learned by example, specifically yours. :) .. but dorsai leads the way.. Unlike other services that are commercial in nature, dorsai is a community based service. While others charge monthly fees for access, dorsai accepts donations from those who can afford to contribute. While other systems don't respond to user input, dorsai thrives on it. Other systems sell hardware for a profit, dorsai donates hardware to community service groups, and to individuals who couldn't afford to normally. Dorsai lives due to the "hacker" ethic of Charles, Jack, Skip, Cara, Ira, Mark, David etc etc etc.. sleepless nights and days working on equipment thats been assembled at the embassy, ( and modifying what ever else available to work the first time..) in order to keep the slip line up... Heres to you bud... I'm one of the few that decided to stay, and am damn glad that I did..... :)	1
I just donwloaded a *.bin file from a unix machine which is supposed to be converted to a MAC format. Does anyone know what I need to do to this file to get it into any Dos, Mac or Unix readable format. Someone mentioned fetch on the unix machine - is this correct? Could someone explain the .bin format a little? Thanks, Elizabeth --	1
Hei Pei. I can not help you directly width you problem, but there may be intermediate roads to take to get to the IFF. I am using a converter that can take IGES, IIF, DXF -> IGES, MILESPEC I IGES, MILESPEC II IGES, IIF, MILESPEC I IIF, MILESPEC II IIF and DXF. IIF is IBM IGES FORMAT. There may be converters out there that can handle IGES to IFF. Hope this was to any help. By the way the converter is part of the IGES Processor/6000 package from IBM and it runs on RS/6000 AIX.	1
Yup. Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right). I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards. You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a 8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way gives a brighter more detailed image. Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better) Have a day!	1

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor design that does just that. It was announced along with the new administration's efforts to cut waste and fuel consumption. I know that in the buildings where I work, gigawatts are wasted by unused, always-on machines and monitors. -Kelley- -- ----------------------------------------------------------------- Thomas Kelley Boylan, PowerPC, IBM Austin, kelleyb@austin.ibm.com	4

I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the logic board. I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two other chips. I'd like to know more about it. Could anyone with any or all of the following information please post it? Thanks a bunch. 1. What does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)? 2. What are the technical details of the re-work? (I'm looking for things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected, and the pin-outs for those chips.) 3. Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without? 4. Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of the operating system? and, finally, 5. Should I even be concerned about any of this?	4
The Duo's can drive Apple's 16" monitor at 832x624 resolution and 256 colors, I think. What non-Apple 16-17" monitors can also be used? Would a multisync NEC-5FG work as well at the same resolution? What are the outstanding points of the Apple monitor when compared with these other monitors?	4
As a side note, in that same ad (MacWorld 6/93), they are selling the 50MHz Powercache for the IIsi with FPU for $575. For those thinking of upgrading to the 040 33 MHz Turbo (an upgrade costs $600 direct from Daystar), this comes out to $1175, about $200 cheaper than what most mail-order companies charge.	4
Anyone know if there is an updated driver for Sony DAT drives?

I hooked up an old 40meg external mac hardrive to a Powerbook 230. I reformatted the drive, copied all the files from the powerbook except the systemfolder, deleted the files from the powerbook (my biggest error, sigh) and then rebooted the whole set up and... chimes of death. I get the following sad mac error, 00000F 000003 I ran Norton and it claims its a bad SCSI driver and suggests replaceing it. I used Apples Disk Tools but I couldn't update the hardrives SCSI driver as it claimed it was in use, but I couldn't even mount the thing (though I could see it when checking the SCSI bus, after turning it on after booting my machine first). What does that error above refer to? Am I on the right track? Is there anything I can do short of intialising the drive, since I need the data on there!	4

I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase. I'm primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones. When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128). Different drives use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others. My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get. So, I'm asking if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or anything else I should probably know. Thanks.	4
What can people tell me about apple's new keyboard, the one that is designed to be more ergonomically friendly? I have begun to experience wrist and hand pains using a standard keyboard, and using a powerbook. What can people with similar experiences tell me? Replies to email please. Paul G.	4
What is the real story here? Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the Centris internal video? Do I need to make my own cable if it doesn't not come with one? Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing such? The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower than that of their mac counterparts... --mike ************************** having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes. at least for the 600x400 configuration. you can get an adaptor called Mac VGA -Q from James engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable. I think the 800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync. I use this on my sony 1604. (gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.	4
+ I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci. Prices + The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and + greater memory capacity. How important is this? How many NuBus cards do you have/plan to acquire? How much memory do you really need? I've got a ci, and 20mb of ram. That's plenty. I also have a 24bit graphics card on the NuBus - I'm a sucker for pretty pictures...I think the LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can not have. At least, not out of the box. + The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci + "32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input. I also like the + "pizza-box" case. The ci is 32-bit clean. I solved the sound input problem with a MacRecorder. But that's gotten to be a fairly expensive solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder. + Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the + LC III being a little slower. The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over. + So, which should I get? Depends on the price you can get the ci for. Educationally speaking, the 4/80 [?] LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under $1300. Add in roughly $500 for a monitor. Last I'd heard, an 8mb LCIII simm went for ~$250. I think you're in a win-win situation. No matter what you decide, you'll most likely be happy with it.	4
So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on its side horizontally? I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side, etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it flat and put it under a low shelf. This is probably not a "newer" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user (comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive? Just curious.....	4
I purchased 2x8 MB 72-pin (60 ns) SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from Chip Merchant (I've been very satisfied with them in the past). Either one alone works, but both together fail. I called Apple for advice and was told that there was a problem with "Composite" SIMMs. Only non-composite SIMMs should be used with the Q-800. Chip Merchant confirmed that they presently sell only composite 72-pin SIMMs. So, Q-800 SIMMs need to be both 60 ns and non-composite.

I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that, but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!! Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz. Speedometer Report for menes rainer. Prepared April 22, 1993.

Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble. The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.

I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key. After absolutely no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support. They tried it out on their Centris 610 and had the same problem. They immediately offered to get a new keyboard, try it on their Centris and ship it to me overnight if it worked. I could send them my keyboard back after I got the one that worked. This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave. It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option. I really like this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it. On the other hand, Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection's is great! -Terry	4
[story about dealing having problems w/C610's deleted] I've had my C610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever. It's been "customized" with--- * replaced the Apple-Quantum 80 drive with a Connor 212 drive. * installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works just fine (though Apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel bezels w/ a standard 5.25" cutout...). It's hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing problems at all, tested printing complex Photoshop graphics. It has expanded VRAM and extra 8 meg SIMM, no problems. So in sum, I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about. -Fred	4

hello out in networld, We have a lab of old macs(SEs and Pluses).

I was wondering what experiences (good or bad) people have had with this sort of upgrade. murray	4
I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost) to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time. This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off screens, reducing clock speed, etc. The advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2) the machine is still available over the network. The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity. Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody logs in via a telnet connection. I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months; that energy is just getting turned into heat. It may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's not too bad. In the summer though, it's a disaster. Not only are you wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat.	4

The article was probably referring to changing the clock oscillator in a manner similar to that done on Quadra 700's and IIsi's. I haven't read a report of this actually being done on a Centris 610 but supposedly this also works on Q900, Q950 and centris 650 machines.	4
Hi, there! I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told, however, that: 1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines with SCSI-2. 2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession capability, which I need. 3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150. Any comments? Thanx.	4
Ah... Ok. I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all the time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.	4

I too had a very unpleasant experience with "Hardware That's Shi*". It featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties I had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of electronics. I shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me something over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes and duties and lost time.	4
This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's to a Quadra 950. I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from the Mac.

I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC. The card is manufactured by Asante. On it i can read: "Asante Tech, inc. Copyright 1991. MACCON + LC REV.B". The card has an fpu socket on it. It provides thin Ethernet connector and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors. My questions are: - Will this card work on any other model than LC-serie ?, given that it's a PDS card, will it work with the IIsi PDS slot ?. I think there may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots. - What's that other conncetor on the card ?. _ Is anyone interested in it ?. I can ship it to any CEE country.	4
Hi. He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one that can see the disk is the owner of the machine.

It probably won't work with any other LC. The ones I have for the LC II are Rev. D. No, it won't work in the IIsi's PDS slot since it's a 68030 PDS, while the LC has the 68020 PDS. The IIsi and SE/30 share the same kind of card. That's the 10BaseT ethernet connector.	4
I recently bought a PLI 21mgbyte floptical drive, and I was very happy with it until I tried to use it to format a 1.4 HD diskette. I put the HD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it correctly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says "this disk is unreadable" and asks if I want to format it) even original systems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to ("initialization failed!") Strangely enough the floptical still reads both the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and if I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a start-up disk. PLI has been unresponsive. Any ideas? Has this happened to anyone before? I was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and now I am looking at an expensive repair.

While traveling with it (it was in my SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive. I lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out). I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers -- though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm never flying with my SE/30 again). And when I called back to ask whether I could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a day (they're usually good for 10 days). The front panel was replaced under warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]). The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the drive mechanism out and send just the case. Unfortunately, I discovered the day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty! Oh, well.	4
Hi Netters. For my home computer I have a humble MacLC with a 12" color monitor. The majority of my work is writing, therefore I would love to have a b&w portrait monotor conected to the LC. However, I sometimes do need the color monitor. My question is this; Is there a good (Cheap) way to hook up two monitors to my LC and is there anyone out there that has done this, how do you like it? Please respond here or to me directly. Thanks for your time, hope to talk to anyone soon! jerry salem	4
I have a IIsi & a portrait display (and I love it). I'm using the built-in video support, so its slow and deals with 16 colors/grays. So, I'm wondering: if I get a video card, how much does this tend to speed up things and will I be able to get more than 4bits? Oh, I have CombiCache w/FPU. Does this limit my choices of video cards? Thanks	4
Hello I recently accelerated my Mac Plus (MicroMac 25MHz accelerator) and now I can't get my Mac to boot off of the hard disk. It boots fine from a floppy, and I can mount the hard disk using SCSI probe, but I cannot get it to boot from the hard drive. I installed a new driver, so I don't think that is the problem. This poses a rather large problem. I only have 4 Meg of RAM, and I need to run Mathematica, which requires 5 Meg. I was hoping to use system 7 virtual memory so that I could run Mathematica. However, I can't run system 7 from a floppy, so I can't get enough RAM. Any suggestions? Thanks for your time-- Chrisw@yang.earlham.edu	4
I'm planning on getting a StyleWriter II for my Mac SE (2.5 MB ram, HD, two 800k floppy drives). Do any of you out there have any recommendations as to whether running System 6.0.8 is better or worse than switching to 7.1. I don't do much real work on this machine any more, but would like to keep it for word processing (Using Word 4 and don't see much advantage to going to Word 5, since it is slower). Any help or comments would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.	4
Since the demise of the Outbound company, what options would exist for me if I were to buy one of their laptops? (1) Since the Outbounds (2030, 2030E, etc) use mac plus roms, won't that severly limit using future applications? (2) What is a reasonable price for one of their laptops? The prices I've seen seem extremely high considering the limited choices now. (3) How reliable have they proven? Any answers would be helpful.	4
this is a bad idea. my machine is on 24 hours a day, but it's actually _doing_ things 24 hours a day. i use it as an all purpose alarm clock, scheduler, i've got routines that run in the middle of the night, phone calls it makes during the day when i'm out. if your machine is _on_ 24 hours a day, then you can count on it to be _working_ 24 hours a day. i could call it from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from work and have it turn the lights on if i'm going to be late (oops, more wasted electricity -- but conversely, i could have it turn the lights _off_). heck, i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner ready when i get there.	4

I vote for turning them off at night. THe stress of off/on is a little harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea. The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along with heat.	4
A friend of mine recently acquired an 8!24 GC card for his IIsi and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white. I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of the GC, but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little more on the subject. Any replies encouraged. Thanks in ad- vance.	4
We are having problems with a bunch of SE/30's in one of our Labs. The fault is that the machines either bomb or freeze when attempting to write to their internal floppies. The internal floppies have been tested on their own and are fine, which means that it is a main board fault. The machines all come from the same batch. The date code on the back of the machines is December 1990. 1. Do you own a machine from this batch. 2. Has any user had experience with this fault. 3. Was it a warranty repair. Any feedback would be appreciated and I will post the results to the net. Bill	4

I have a PLP II laser printer make by GCC Technologies. I have problem with a dirty first page. The top portion of the first is always smeared with black toner across the page. If I print more than one page at the same time, the problem does not occur on other pages. I cleaned the printer but still does not help. Can anyone offer any solutions? or know the phone # to GCC Technologies? Thanks in advance Charles,	4
I have an opportunity to buy a Radius VideoVision board for about 1/3 of normal street price, which I believe is due to a change in the board architecture. I VAGUELY, MAYBE remember that there was some kind of serious problem with this board, which does Composite, PAL, SECAM to S video, Composite, etc coversions. Plus also generating quicktime movies, etc. MacWeek was generally complimentary about it in the April 12th issue. Does anyone have any information on this board, such as is it the one which has been superceeded, what about an upgrade if so, etc. I'd be very curious to hear from you. THANKS! --B.W.	4
I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago, and lately, when I print something, I notice white lines or "gaps" running through the line being printed. It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when advancing lines. I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem, but the lines are still there. Has anyone else noticed this problem? What's the best way to get rid of it?	4

Performa 200 == Classic II Performa 400 == LC II Performa 4xx == LC III Performa 600 == well, nothing :) The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions. The 4xx have bundled software, modems, etc. Because they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper discount on them. Shop around. As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party. Much cheaper.	4
I have a few questions that I would like answers to (or opinions on) since I'm thinking about buying a LC-III: Q1) When the PowerPC-based Macs are announced, what will happen to the 680X0-based Macs? Q2) Is System 7 the 'last word' for 680X0-based Macs? Will we ever get REAL multi-tasking for the Mac? Q3) Will there be a way for NuBUS/PDS-equipped Macs to add a PowerPC-on-a-board to their systems? I'd hate to think that I'm going to put my $$ down on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a dead-end product line! Thanks in advance,	4
I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!). Have you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's and option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several times to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those white annoying lines. Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big black box. It can help to get the ink flowing. Good luck! Beth Corbo	4
Iv'e got a problem printing with a StyleWriterII. I am printing from a IIvx with 20 megs ram. I am trying to print a Quark file that has 2 fonts a couple of boxes and 3 gradient fills. Two things happen: I get a " Disk is full" error, that I can't find documented, I also have parts of letters that are over one of the gradient fills get cut off. This only happens to the text over the fill. Text adjecent in a different box is uneffected. Any ideas?	4
[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications as a self-styled "expert", in fact, when I read about anybody using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ] Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent and driver-related stuff. In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble of ROM-swapping. The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1. Sure. Buy a used IIci motherboard. Call Pre-Owned Electronics, Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price on a IIci ROM. Everything has a price. If you happen to find somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might get a decent price. There is probably a market for used mother- boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway. Ask for a quote and then try offering less? Pre-Owned and Shreve have been known to dicker. Their ads in various trade magazines often list considerably different prices for the same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well. Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading the ROM in a IIx.	4
Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2 modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O controller than the Q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.	4
I just put a 33MHz 040 CPU into my Centris 610. Now I have a math coprocessor, but is it possible to speed up the Centris to run at either 25MHz or 33MHz?? I didn't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the IIsi's motherboard! Where is the oscillator for the Centris? Any ideas? Thanks	4
Hey All- We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab. It had given us flawless service until last week. The problem: Someone in our lab has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer"). the DB25 SCSI plug runs through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin rectangular connector. Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine, to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug. Since the 26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25. He came in and asked if he could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used). Naive fools that we are, we said o.k.. His computer failed to recognize the drive. Now, none of the computers in our lab will recognize it. We tried Disk Doctor, and it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain. Could installing the SCSI upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board? The drive seems to spin up all right and unpark itself upon powerup. The events are too coincidental to attribute the problem to stiction. Any help greatly appreciated-	4
Does anyone out there know how to add an additional internal hard-drive to a mac IIsi. NOT to replace the already existing hardrive! I was think of hooking to internal drive together or any other ways to add internal harddrive beside replacement. I just don't wanadd an external harddrive. I'm open to any suggestions..please response to the address below. thanks	4
Anyone have a phone number for Applied Engineering so I can give them a call?	4
I have done several of these upgrades (about 6 IIsi's, and 1 Quadra 700), and the best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". If possible, you should look for the silicon-free stuff. There's a comany who makes the stuff called Tech Spray, their address is: P.O. Box 949, Amarillo, TX 79105. You should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct tape that stuff is for ducts... When using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small space between the heat sink and the CPU. Mario Murphy	4
I am running System 7.1 on a Centris 610. I have not been able to setup my printer yet because when I open Chooser, I get a blank screen. I do have all kinds of print drivers but none shows up. I even do not get a port iconn either. It is just one big BLANK screen. Your help is very appreciated. BTW I did rebuild the desktop but that did not help either.	4
Wrong, the CD300 (external) is just a plain ol' SCSI device. No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing. Its just that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability. Multisession means that when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can read and display them. Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding sound) at around double the speed. CD150 is not multisession capable. This means that you lose the ability to add any more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD). Finally, since the CD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer data (excluding sound).	4

Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser. I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments from the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU (namely a PB170). What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice video port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this type of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb. All comments appreciated.	4
In my quest for speed, I've run into a problem. 66.66 mhz and 80 mhz clock oscillators are available but I haven't found any speeds between 66.66 and 70 mhz for further testing. Fox Electronics (813) 693-0099 can make custom oscillators but if anyone knows a source cheaper than $12/osc please let me know. Some 68 and 70 mhz units would complete my speed trials on the old Q700	4
I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc., etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is because the designers put them there deliberately. The real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or maliciousness. --	4
Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput. They also have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and reduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)	4
In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's 1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed by different people. Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the Memory Chimes. Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer. In both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback, my marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are "lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something? Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving. I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a 2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution. Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world. Ted	4
Your source is wrong. The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a typical hard disk. The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the CD300. None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card. You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD. It's just faster reading images off of a disk. I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD, but only single session. The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.	4
[ description deleted] any idea on prices??	4
Thanks for the enlightening post. Is there a Technical Note on this? The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac, but rather, any of various workstations that use the 68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs. I used to own a NeXT 68030 cube. But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system 7 on it. Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power? Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference. I have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo. When editing relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several seconds, often more than 6 seconds!! This happens with power cycling turned off. As usual, MS software is maggot-infested feces. I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.	4
I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace. These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases fairly often. But nothing works. The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity. Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any ideas? They would be much appreciated. -- Andrew Geweke	4

We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-) This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications, even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ;-) We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the cache was turned OFF (yes OFF). This is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it, but did it twice within an hour yesterday). The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway). These included: -swapping the RAM -swapping the VRAM -swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB) -swapping cables -disconnecting HD and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals Here are some other facts: -when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out) -the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab -Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us. Here are some speculations: -I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring). -the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do not want to believe it. -it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site. Has anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less time available to read news! :-) Thank you in advance.

From article <1993Apr22.165659.8890@desire.wright.edu>, by demon@desire.wright.edu (Not a Boomer): Hmmm... that's not quite right. The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO). I also don't think they are so much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution. Why else bundle at ease (among other things)? Hardly a business application. What do you mean by 'no "retail price"'. Quite the contrary, I think. The price is darn near the same all across the country. That (again, IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling required. Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set. One price, medium performance, ready to go. When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears (*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00. Why I chose one over the other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who sells Apples?). Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know didly about the computers, peecee or mac. But then, neither did any of the Apple dealers I spoke with... If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time. Go figure. I'm *real* happy with my Performa. Oh, and I bought the Apple Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party). Happy with that decision as well. I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas. -- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Instrument Approach Procedures Automation DOT/FAA/AMI-230	4

I've had faxes sent to me which is great but I've been home to set it. I don't have a need to set fax receiving up all day. Also I hear there is a device that can channel all incoming phone signals for about $70. Rumor also that the phone company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what you need. Best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback. * Freddie 1.2.5 * Clinton: The Tax Man Cometh & Cometh & Cometh & keeps on coming	4
Interesting, as I think computer technology is now becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position which must require a degree. I know of several people I work with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year. They also didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :( I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade practice, than a truly specialty field. It will be even more so in the future. If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field of Software Engineering. The difficulties for example of designing scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides the missing key for some good groundwork! Well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out of a Top 10 comp sci school. The trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the rest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even if you don't get a TOP salary. Which I have always been a poor slob throughout school but if you follow this rule: BOOK=SALARY=FOOD&SHELTER you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry. What else could a man want?!	4
[deleted] This is a pet peeve of mine. I wish companies would put power switches on the front of the equipment! If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front, I would happily power it off at night. Almost every piece of computer equipment I own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and modems--why?). I hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon. Rich	4
This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present. This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with. Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. Issues: Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without add on cards. All reported machines were able to use 25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and hi density floppy disk problems have been reported. Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence, the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at higher speeds. Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was repaired and the machine is operational. One other reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron. No reports of static discharge damage. No reports of high speed operation causing damage. Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of defective parachutes. Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with success. See case histories Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed. These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a bolt through the hole in the motherboard. Case Histories: All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported CPU versions were 20 mhz. 1) 27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing. No FPU or other add on card Heatsinked CPU only On 24 hours/day No damage during installation 2) 27.5 mhz operational without Apple Nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with Apple Nubus card installed Heatsinked CPU only On 24 hours/day No floppy problems No damage during installation 3) 27.5 mhz operational. Unable to boot at 31 mhz Heatsinked CPU only No floppy problems No damage during installation 4) 25 mhz operational Works with the following two configurations a) Realtech FPU adaptor card Realtech Cache card SuperMac 8*24 PDQsi b) SuperMac FPU adaptor card SuperMac Video Spigot SuperMac 8*24 PDQsi 5) 33 mhz operational Fuzzy startup sound Problems with hi density disks 6) 33 mhz operational Fuzzy startup sound Heat sink on CPU and chip to right of CPU 7) 25 mhz operational. Occasional crash at 33 mhz 8) 25 mhz operational. Using FPU rated at 16 mhz without difficulty 9) 25 mhz operational. PDS adapter with a Spectrum 24PDQsi graphics card and a VideoSpigot, a 20MHz FPU Heat sink on CPU 10) 25 mhz operational. 33 mhz failed after several hours. 11) 25 mhz operational 5/80+quicksilver/fpu(only upgrade) 12) 25 mhz operational. Tried 33 mhz - system won't start. Heat sink on CPU Configured with RealTech FPU/adapter card Supermac 8*24 PDQsi Realtech cache. CPU on continuously - no problems.

I recently got a Centris 610 4/230 on my desk. It's a vast improvement on my previous machine (a IIsi 5/40). However ..... I've encountered a problem with fonts .. Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my previous mac using System 7.01 now look wierd ! Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be truncated. I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. I'm using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my IIsi - when things worked perfectly. We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1. Apple UK adopted their usual "friendly" approach and told us to call our local dealer - God help us !!

Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up development work. Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three years late. Designing metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA, now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly. Any other suggestions?	4

According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa 405 is not the same as an LCIII. It only has a 16Mhz 68030 while the LCIII has a 25Mhz 030. Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have forgotten to remove the description that was next to the actual computer. Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge about Macs as I do about DOS machines.	4

I am boring my sister HP DeskJet 500C for the weekend and I was wondering in their was any drivers for it available some where that would allow me to use it with my Mac SE/30. I have a copy of MacPrint but I do think that I have a driver for the 500C. I would be happy to get it working in black & white, but if there is away to get the color working that would be better. Any ideas someone? Regards,	4

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than the smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and rotational speed. This utility should let you know what the differences are between the drives. *************************************************************************** The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.

Hi everyone, I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing on the HP Deskwriter (Sys 7.1, Deskwriter driver 3.1, PowerBook 170). When I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message "Spooling to disk," but sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus, I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its status as "Multifinder NOT aware" allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as "HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly." Have you ever seen this problem before. There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing "sleep" from the Finder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory map, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted reloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as usual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep? Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software.	4
Can anyone tell me the procedure for hooking a Personal Laserwriter NTR serially to a mac? The documentation says it can be done, but I'm not sure of the correct switch setting to use out of the given non-appletalk switch options.

I read in a recent Tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting a 68030 in a PB100. I am interested in doing so, but would like to know more about it. Does it involve just replacing the 68000 that is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter- board. Also, would the 68030 be able to run QT with the PB100's screen(not pretty I know, but possible?) And of course, what would the damage be ($). Any info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

I guess he is right. Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either, but they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free ROM upgrade from RasterOps. Very easy. If you boot without the MODE32 control panel, then it will disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. So when you run OK you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. Check About this Macintosh and see if you havce a 12+MB system. sent seperately.	4
The 486 at the same CLOCK is NOT as fast as the 040 at the same clock speed. The '040 also has much better floating point unit. Now the DX2-66 is faster than the '040 at 33Mhz. But for your reference the 486 at 33 mhz gets ~14MIPS while the '040 at 33mhz gets ~20MIPS.	4

I guess the real question is: Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_. Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW) isolated from every other factor and influence in the system? Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)! I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has _a lot_ to do with the "power" of a CPU in a particular application. If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given, then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick. If you have to fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then your cycle count goes through the roof! well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose. The orginal question was about classifying micro-processors... having re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given. That's it for another $0.02. Cheers everyone. ~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~= Peter Pundy Email: 2545500@jeff-lab.queensu.ca	4

The above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with the true facts is also today the main source of ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists' illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of the innocent victims of the Turkish genocide. The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the following provisions: The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution 95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world; Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity; and Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious scourge, international cooperation is required; Members agree as hereinafter provided: Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish. Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: A) Killing member of the group; B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group; Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable: a) Genocide b) Conspiracy to commit genocide c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide d) Attempt to commit genocide. Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private individuals. Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE), to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE), to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE).

May 13, 1993 _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly "carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers." A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said "the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal," the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported. But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment. "This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes," the statement reads. The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes. Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war. The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities. It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.	17
Timbo, Israel has not been recognized as a state by the Arabs, except for Egypt, of course. Isn't that a gesture? What has Israel offered? Well, it has been calling for peace talks for 45 years, asked for economic relations, and asked for diplomatic ties. What else is there? Would you have Israel sacrifice its security? Nay, I think not.	17

What's this? Another idiot from McRCIM.McGill.EDU? Or are these all the same dope using different accounts?	17
OK, you've already disqualified yourself (who ever you are) from being objective. Jews are a people with a common cultural heritage, religion, and history. We are not a race. You don't see a difference between killing British soldiers (who were preventing Jews who tried to escape the Nazis from entering the British mandate) and Arab terrorist who kill civilian men, women, and children?!? That's ridiculuous on atleast two counts. First of all, even if you identify yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're a self-hating anti-semite. One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with their identities (since they only want Jews to be cowering victims) and are willing to speak up for their enemies. Secondly, the strength or weakness of your arguments does not depend on your identity.	17

My recollection of History/Documentary books is slitely different. It is my understanding that Croats were allies of Germany during WWII, while Serbs had sided with Russia. As a result Serbs did take a beating from Croats (NOT Bosnian Moslems) while Germany had the upper hand. Even today, Russians consider/call Serbs as their Slovac brothers. This is one of the issues involved in the U.N.'s lack of active intervention against Serbs. As for the Bosnian Moslems, I have not heard of any alliance with Germany or Russia in recent history. Therefore, I am curious if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past history.	17

Not to muslims :) That could be arguable.. (for bandwith and flames sake, I wont say more) It is a civil war, but the serbian generals who allow rape are not fighting fair. Yah I know .. war is hell .. those serbian generals are propretuating both.. Lines and bordres .. money .. power .. fear .. Let's change canadian bordres while we are at it :) I see this as civvil war.. (sp borders) Possibly.. I do agree that it is a civil war, which makes the donation of humanitarian aid even more complex... I mean serbs are bleeding too and I heardthat a few croats had raped serbian women.. (unconfurmable at this point)	17
Nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this. It does not appear in several long published accounts by Irgun participants. Even some Irgun propagandists do not make this claim. Several members of the Irgun attacking party, including the leader, deposited personal declarations in the Irgun archives (Jabotinsky Institute, Tel-Aviv) which state that the Lehi proposed to "liquidate the village after the conquest". It seems the Begin overruled this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive character evidence. The Haganah tried to get the Irgun to attack a village with real military significance, but it was considered too hard. The soft target of Deir Yassin was chosen instead. There was intention (probably originating with Begin) to give such a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before reaching the village. Everyone knows that. By all rational standards, you should be posting from b-cpu. A lie repeated is still a lie.	17
Anas Omran... @> But since all Jews that way, they find him a leader to follow!	17
Actually, the record of the Allies activities, in the face of incontrovertible evidence as to what the Nazis (may they rot in hell) were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done nothing. The railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease of doing so. The US, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance of Jews from Europe, primarily for public relations, so that the government could say it was "doing something". Many ships with refugees were turned away from US shores; some found refuge in Cuba or South America, many others sunk or had to return to Europe (with predictable consequences). The hope today is that we have collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other countries' "internal affairs". The sad reality is that this does not seem to be the case.	17
shut up andi!	17
Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected while a Jewish party member was accepted. If you examine these I am sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power base that his Jewish counterpart had. The party structure in Israel has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go. Knesset members for most parties are now elected via primaries. The top standing members end up with cabinet posts. This is purely a political power issue. Check the ranking of Arab labor party members, as opposed to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees. Once again, if for arguments sake, all the Arab Israelis were to vote for Labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the power shift. You are overlooking the fact that they wield political power as individuals based upon a wider collective power base. The reasoning I see at work is purely political. As far as security goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews as well - e.g. Sharon.	17
What say you and Nick go somewhere else with this shool yard crap.	17
You *know* that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is *only* going to generate flames, not discussion. Try adding some substance to the issue of "gestures" you mentioned. What is it you feel that Israel *has* offered as a "gesture"? What would you (*realistically*) expect to see presented by the Arabs/Palestinians in the way of "gesture"? What are the "rules" that have been bent by Arab actions? It would seem that the Israeli deportations were seen by the other side as an example of "changing the rules".	17
What if we remove one zeron and make it "the genocide of two hundred thousands Muslims in Bosnia..", would that make it any better..? And how about the 2,000,000 Muslims who were driven and continue to be driven out of their homes..? is that "utterly ridiculous claim"? And how about the rapes (over 60,000 women) and the concentration camps..? The us delegation which visited them reported yesterday on CNN that the serbs are giving the muslims detainees 4 biscuits and a cup of water a day..!!?? That sure also sounds like an "utterly ridiculous claim".!	17
# # # ># So Steve: Lets here, what IS zionism? # # > Assuming that you mean 'hear', you weren't 'listening': he just # > told you, "Zionism is Racism." This is a tautological statement. # # I think you are confusing "tautological" with "false and misleading." No, but you're right that I didn't express myself well. The dialog went: A: "Zionism is racism." B: "What IS zionism?" DC: "You weren't listening, were you?" In other words, the first statement *defined* a Zionism of discourse. Everything else was redundant.	17
So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings, and condemn all his supporters, while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of innocents, Muslim or not, in Bosnoia-Herzegovina? Hatred and bigotry remain just that, no matter who practices them.	17

If somebody wishes to counter the reality she described, fine. [PTS] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [PTS] [PTS] [PTS] The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective [PTS] -------------------------------------------------------- [PTS] By Alec Rasizade [PTS] [PTS] [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh [AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western [AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [AR] Armenian-American community. Azeri views on this dispute have [AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media. Therefore let me [AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the [AR] origins of the conflict. During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject, a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri. The following should be interesting. [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic. Actually, [AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian [AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988, [AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia. Following that move, [AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait [AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990. This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September 1991, page 28, we read: "By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 Armenian inhabitants fled the city..." Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away." In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988! [AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule [AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of "divide and [AR] rule." Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [AR] history of the conflict. It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions. [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in [AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an [AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed. Those interested in [AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian [AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran. Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno- Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict. [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri [AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and [AR] adjacent rural districts. Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the [AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly [AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly [AR] nationalistic National Independence Party. It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and play dead. [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country [AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed? In the [AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish [AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government [AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and [AR] possessions? The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive Armenians of "lands, homes, and possessions". [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West. [AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian [AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible, [AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus. True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach! [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea. [AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western [AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security [AR] alliances. These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led [AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed [AR] May 15, 1992. On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the [AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct. [AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces. Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia! Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe. [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an [AR]"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan." The truth is that the Armenians [AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century. Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim. Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as "Artsakh", which comes from the Urartian term "Urtekhe-Urtekhini". NO Azeris yet! Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena". NO Azeris yet! In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet! From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervan. NO Azeris yet! Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet! End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet! By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet! Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen "To Armenia". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet! In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000. It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh! In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some Muslims in Karabakh! In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188 priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh -- assuming no Kurds! Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920: "The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis Republic. Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet Armenia and Azerbaidzan! Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan N. Narimanov People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Guseinov" [AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian [AR] rule. No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule in the Caucasus, including Karabakh! [AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew [AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris. How [AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in [AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and [AR] demanded separation from California? Non-sequitur. [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement [AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians. That is correct. Armenian historians don't say this! [AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the [AR] fourth century. But those ancient residents had no link to and [AR] nothing in common with Armenians. Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an argument totally invalid! [AR] Azeris would have a better claim to [AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited, [AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation. Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity, Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan. [AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the [AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the [AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual [AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders. This [AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [AR] nations, not just by Turkey. Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of Armenians. [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the [AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran. The second key to untying the [AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the [AR] U.N. definition of 1974. Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local population! [AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should [AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as [AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the [AR] former Yugoslavia. Such decisive collective international action can [AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri [AR] conflict from growing and spreading. Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as an act of Allied aggression! [AR] Dr. Alec Rasizade, senior research officer at the Academy of Sciences [AR] of Azerbaijan, is a visiting researcher at the Harriman Institute of [AR] Columbia University in New York. Ha!	17
Great, someone will be posting from 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' next At this time the PLO did not exist and would not for the next 20 years. You knew that didn't you? Perhaps you might want to add up all the Jewish civilians killed during the 48 War. I'll opt for the massacre at Deir Yassin. Which do you think is the greater? While we are talking about this man I have included more of his testimony that Harry naturally does not use nor does Myths and Facts. I wonder why. No doubt he was lying right Harry? "The reason was mainly economic. That is to capture booty in order to maintain the bases which we had then established with very poor resources. The main idea, despite this, remained the conquest of the village by force of arms, something which was then unknown in the country, and became a turning point in Jewish military operations" Yehuda Lapidot, Jabontinsky Archives Testimony "Apart from the military discussion, the Lehi put forward a proposal to liqui- date the residents of the village after the conquest, in order to show the Arabs what happens when the IZL and the Lehi set out together on an operation, and for another main reason - it would cause a great uproar throughout the land and would be an important turning point in the course of the battles. The clear aim was to break the Arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu- nity in Jerusalem, which had been hit hard time after time, especially recenctly by the desecration of Jewish bodies which fell into Arab hands" Yehuda Lapidot, Jabotinsky Archives testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in "The Deir Yassin File", published by Koteret Rashit 19th January 1983 So it wasn't like the Holocaust more like Lidice - a warning, a punishment. Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through. "When it comes to prisoners, old people and children, there were differences of opinion, but the majority was for liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us, whether it be old people, women or children Benzion Cohen Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin, (J.A.T.) Let me put in some words here a. premeditated b. murder What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command? "We had prisoners and before the retreat we decided to liquidate them. We also liquidated the wounded, as anyway we could not give them first aid. In one place about eighty Arab prisoners were killed after some of them had opened fire and killed one of the people who came to give them first aid. Arabs who dressed up as Arab women were also found, and so they started to shoot the women also who did not hurry to the area where the prisoners were concentrated" (J.A.T.) Shooting prisoners, the wounded, as a warning to hurry? Sounds VERY familiar to me, how about you? Heard of other people other places doing these things? "In one case - the Zahran family - only one out of twenty five survived. In another house they caught the sixteen year old son Fuad. His mother was holding him. They killed him with a knife. The mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital. A young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street. Their bodies were left there. They moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard, as soon as anybody opened his door. They were using bombs [grenades], machine-guns, submachine-guns. My cousin escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes. One of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards, killing everybody who moved. They killed my uncle, Ali Hassan Zeidan, and my aunt Fatima. She heard him call 'help me'. She ran to him and they killed her. Another neighbour Haj Yarah, heard some voices and came out. They killed him too. His son Muhammad, who was about seventeen, heard his father call him and went to the same place. They killed him. His mother heard her son cry for help. She ran out and they killed her. That was near my house. I saw this" Muhammad Arif Sammour Funny how 'Myths and Facts' does not see fit to include this too - after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events? What do you say about this Harry? "In the exchange that followed four men were killed and a dozen were wounded.. ..by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had ceased. Although there was a calm, the village had not yet surrendered. The Irgun and Lehi men came out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses. They shot whoever they saw, women and children included, the commanders did not try and stop the massacre...I pleaded with the commander to order his men to cease fire, but to no avail. In the meantime twenty five Arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through Mahane-Yehuda and Zichron Yosef. At the end of the drive, they were taken to the quarry bvetween Deir Yassin and Givat Shaul, and murdered in cold blood" Meir Pa'il, interview with Yediot Ahronot 4|4|1972	17
What is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners, promising to execute Rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the Iran/Iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc Christians in Egypt, massacring Christians in Sudan, harassing Christians in and barring Jews from Saudi Arabia? How are paranoid Muslims "righteous in defending themsselves" in these situations? Who are they even afraid of? Considering that you seem to be posting from central New Jersey, this is an odd comment coming from you. I dare you to speak your mind in the Middle East in any country besides Israel.	17
I suppose for the same reason Jews call the Occupied Territory, Judea and Sumaria. It's called propaganda and if you repeat lies often enough, people start to believe it.	17
Actually, You're wrong as well. The KKK is allowed to march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected (Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year). Morality should not be legilated in a free country like the U.S. I'll post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those Hoos bashers.	17

Box 215 Nazareth, 16101 Israel Phone (972)-6-561923 Fax (972)-6-564934 The Arab Association for Human Rights (HRA) was formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian citizens. It is a unique association concerned with the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian national minority in Israel. Among the issues of concern are land confiscation, education, prison conditions, unemployment, torture and the unequal allocation of Israel's resources. Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living within the Green line (the pre-1967 borders of Israel), constituting 18% of Israel's citizens. For them it is an empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the needs of the Jewish population. Legally and practically, Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not been fulfilled. This is apparent in many areas strongly affecting the Palestinian national minority. Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 1948. The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does not receive a fair share of state resources. On a day-to- day level, Palestinians face discrimination in many different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission to build a house, start a business, find a job or educate their children.

Mr. Oguocha, "Muslims" in the Bosnian context are in fact "Turks"... In fact, correct me if I am wrong, Serbs are attacking Bosnians with their battle cries "Death to the Turks!". Is this so shocking? Years of communism apparently suppressed their hatred and anger towards the Turks. But such hatred is obviously one that dies hard. Serbs must understand, Turks are no longer the good old barbarians world has come to know by propaganda after propaganda. Serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work. Serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have to face counter-barbarism. So, I urge those people [Serbs] to stop killing Bosnian women and children. And they must never forget that Turks in the motherland are watching...patiently. Cordially,	17

From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Rabin and his Palestinians kapos Rabin's plans for a Palestinian police (from The Other Front, Alternative Information Center, Jerusalem, 5 May 1993) "The decision to view the setting up of a local police force for (sic) the Palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a sign of the Israeli government's serious attitude towards the peace process. "The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package', but deals with the very heart and substance of the Palestinian struggle for national identity. As it turns out, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories." Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily Hadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy, something which will restrict what can be done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian police force', rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go back on his decision. Members of the Kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the Occupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future Palestinian police force. However, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the new police force - as far as the Israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over whom they will apparently have no authority, but will control political groups within the Palestinian population, whom the government is interested in neutralizing. Writes Barzilai: "...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede, not only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement. "The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a local Palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the Palestinians..." It's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal Husseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a variety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would like to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans.	17
If Croats are now divided, it is because Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia. Croats in Croatia, B-H, and Serbia were in *one* country--Yugoslavia-- until they divided themselves.

That Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does *not* give them the right to divide Serbs in Yugoslavia.

"In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days." "Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies." "...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response: 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia.'[155] Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars) constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, "Armenia on the Road to Independence.") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They are: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard R. Hartill; "Adventures in the Near East" by A. Rawlinson; "World Alive, A Personal Story" by Robert Dunn. Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia, Sir Oliver Wardrop. "An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound."

Look nobody asked those countries about their UN forces to be on the ground. They can take their forces which are incomponent and ineffective at the first place. And let whoever are willing to do the job what it takes. How anyone can defend this stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian military? How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching the shelling on cities and towns everyday? How anyone can defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective when Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age groups? I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian muslims is just an insult to their casualties. I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue. Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this world. Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to cultural difference and minorty closer to their home. Because they get rid of their minorities long long time ago starting in 15th centuries. And they let Adolph to take care of the rest in 20th Century. But he was much more naughty than they expected because he dared to step many toes. So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what they were thinking the same yesterday.	17

Gulf has changed the third parts's perception of Arabs. 1. Before, people tended to think Arabs have tough character. After seeing Iraqis begging for surrender, people do not gave Arabs much weight. 2. People tended to think Arabs are a united people in fighting Isrealis. After Gulf War, seeing some Arab nations beated up Iraqis in order to waiver the debt to U.S. and Kuwaitis consistly trying to draw West nations to hit Iraq again, people started to see Arab World as a dog cage, echoing sound of barking.	17
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Labour's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT Labour's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by Israel Shahak publ. in Middle East International, London, 30.4.93 It is not difficult to discover Israel's policy towards the Palestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, though. The torrents of claptrap about "the peace process" must be totally ignored, as must Israel's official pronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. By concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent that Labour's policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation. Likud's policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot Aharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip into four, "autonomous" Palestinian enclaves, all of them under Israeli supervision. The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves. The entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already been turned into a "Greater Jerusalem" where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them. Judging from Labour's settlement policy, it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank: two in "Samaria" and two in "Judea" (i.e. north and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more than two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to "Greater Jerusalem", Labour's policies hardly deviate from Sharon's. A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon's extravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that, while "barely a few months ago" Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line, "no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken". And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that "as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud's ways". The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in "Samaria". Therefore the belt of settlements around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", designed to separate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount importance. According to the latest data, the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population (apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But for the area around the "Trans-Samaria Highway", the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is increasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of the "Efrat Block" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron, is pretty much the same. The "Efrat Block" is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway. The project is costly in the extreme, because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels. The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin's return from his US visit in March. The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole. Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in Ha'aretz in March. He mentions having seen "a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000". His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively: "We continue to steal the Strip's water, even though its quality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to steal the Strip's tiny land resources, in order to found there more and more settlements, as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair, and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is by our own doing that the Strip's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working. From the military point of view, we have kept control of no more than half the Strip's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry, I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it." Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too. Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by the first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is. "The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a substantial proportion of cut flowers." He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive, considerably augmented by the present government. Owing to them, housing units are cheap. The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. "Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels ($6,500)." Such data shows that Israel's plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel. The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March: "From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip's workers could be barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate data is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed..." Gaza's total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli factories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of small workshops, employing an average of four workers, get their raw materials or unfinished products, together with detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that "the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees." If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast. They are higher still when "a Gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home, with the family's help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work." Many of them are women and children, paid about ten shekels ($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip. Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel's conquest [in 1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the talk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures intended to "encourage economic development in the territories", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet. "Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good colonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the natives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not become rebellious, and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis, its economic interests included," wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela's diagnosis. Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. "In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is simplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government, or even the trade and industry minister alone, a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this does not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production." Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) not only to Israel but also to Europe, where they otherwise might compete with Israeli exports. Perpetuaring apartheid Labour's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv, who deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to Likud's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth "occured during the term of office of the National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister". Likud's reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons. To sum up: Labour's policy, unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented. According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, and the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying price in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is recognised, the less suffering it may cause.	17
From: Center for Policy Research <cpr> Subject: Zionists reject non-Jews. News Ethiopian Jews and not-quite Jews The Israeli press has published items about Ethiopian Jews waiting in camps in Addis Ababa for immigration to Israel, who are dying of starvation. The following are excerpts from an interview with the former general director of the JDC project for development and welfare of Ethiopian Jews, Kobi Friedman (Hadashot, 21 April 1993), who has stated that "there are people dying in Addis Ababa, but they are converts to Christianity": "Hadashor published the item about the dying Jews after viewing a video tape filmed last week in Adis Ababa. How do you know that they are actually converts to Chritianity ? "If there are Jews on the tape, then I don't know what to say. I am speaking from experience when I say that those who remained in Ethiopia are Christians. I know that there have previously been things published in the press by interesting parties, and there is no connection between them and reality." "What interested parties ?" "Ethiopian immigrants who want their Christian relatives to come here." "What to you recommend that Ethiopian children in Israel do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives remain in Ethiopia ?" "I ask if it is the job of the State of Israel to bring in the 40 relatives who stayed in Ethiopia. Well, my answer is that it is not. It would be a better solution, economically as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to Ethiopia and reunite with his family there."	17
I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of other countries in peril. I wonder whether US or other countries would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and Hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (I am no student of history and I am just asking questions.) I don't think they would have. After all the U.S. was one of the countries that turned away Jewish refugees when there was still time to get them out. (Considered and rejected at the Cabinet level then..) ... Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries, is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such. As I understand it, International law provides the right of any country to intervene to prevent genocide. I think once the World Court has ruled that genocide is being committed... If a Human Rights Czar is appointed at the U.N., we could have international monitors recording events and responses of local officials and develop an objective basis. This could be backed by adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's command. I would like to see the U.N. directly impose ICJ rulings whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court ruling). The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!). The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the Security Council). The UN SC is quite a flawed body. Rogue governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force without requiring further SC action. (The PRC even continues to threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling. The current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..). Peace,	17
Funny you should mention. That's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss. Source: 'United Nations, Human Development Report,' 1990. Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity: Turkiye, Greece and Chile are in the same category. That is, $3,000 - $5,999. Source: 'International Economics: Theory and Policy' by Paul R. Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld, Harper Collins Publishers, 1991, (second edition). In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity,' Greece is in the same category with Turkiye. Indeed, Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle. The economy is in shambles, corruption is rampant, air pollution is in outrageous dimensions, state-sponsored terrorism is the name of the game and infrastructure is decaying. Another insightful article in the New York Times (Sunday, April 7) exposes the dirty linen of Greece, and describes her as the pariah of the European Community. The article reports that ''...with un-European antics, Greece uses the Community as a cash register. She squanders, and at times even steals the European tax payers' money for political featherbedding at home. The principal members of the Community admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European Community.'' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that notwithstanding her geographic location, Greece is un-European in mentality and attitude. Indeed, during the last 12 years, Turkiye registered a great success with regard to economic restructuring. A sound economy, ready to be integrated to the world economies, has emerged, succeeding to the faltering one, witnessed in the '70s. Just 12 years ago, Greece used to export double as much as Turkiye did. Now inversely, Turkiye's overall exports exceed by far that of Greece. As far as the tourism incomes are concerned, we are witnessing the same phenomenon. The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in world terrorist organizations), thereby solving this issue completely. Indeed, in the '70s, it was out of the question to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West. Nowadays, this is not the case at all, and in a far remote town, even in a village you may have, at any time, a long-distance call to any given country. However, the same could not be applied to Greece. In fact, it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany round the clock. And if you happen to be in the Greek islands, then your chance will be pretty slim. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. Greece, by virtue of its full membership, has enjoyed all advantages of the EC, obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies. Turkiye, having no access at all to similar financial supports, has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus over the last two years. As such, Turkiye deserves to be the only country in its region having permanent current accounts surplus. Serdar Argic	17

But, I get pleasure from watching you make a fool of yourself. So you stand by the statement that all Armenians are barbarians. OK, I see. Lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human. See Serdar, when you judge people because of their race this is called racism. I tend to frown on this sort of thing. Obviously you don't. When you label an entire race the way you do, it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings, and this can make GENOCIDE possible. But I guess (and this is where Serdar will fill the page with quotes taken out of context) you know that, huh? Don't you find it weak that all of Serdars enemies are Fascist/NAZI/barbarian/_________fill in the blank with any catch all bad term. Public knowlege? I was not aware of that. NOW I see, the ARMENIANS decide to kill the Israeli athletes in 1972 as PRACTICE. I was confused, but thanks for clearing that up. Wow, you are on a roll with the accusations today Serdar, so how did the Armenians steal from the Turkish children? Was it their lunch money? This is very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet you fill out every day. It really touches my heart. Oh and thank you for letting me know that Kurds and Armenians hate each other. I was not aware of this. The only time I have ever talked about Kurds it was about the WONDERFUL treatment they were recieving in Turkey. They must have a high incedence of insanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the non-oppresive Turkish government that has let their culture flower over the past 70 years. Thanks for the unbiased TURKISH MEDIA SOURCE. I am sure the Milliyet is rated number one for accuracy and truth. Innocent? Is that what terrorists call their victims? I have never heard of terrorists calling their victims innocent. "Yes, folks in other news the IRA public relations department reported that it had killed 20 innocent victims in a car bombing... " Nope Serdar, I don't think so. Oops you almost forgot to fill in the "Say something about Turks being killed by Armenians here" section of your note.	17

Actually, this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way. Bosinan Muslims, in collaboration with the Nazis, did to Serbians after the first world war what Serbs are doing to Muslims now. This is not a fresh case of ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga of intense mutual hatred, destruction,... Not taking sides in this perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry. It could just be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does not even know the meaning of the word.

5 Apr 93 MOSCOW (UPI) -- ... ``It's horrible. People are trying to get their wives and children out, men are leaving their defense positions, it's total anarchy,'' said Mekhman Aliyev, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani president. Aliyev said 210 people -- three-quarters of them civilians, the rest government soldiers -- had been killed and 200 wounded in the assault by Armenian fighters. Serdar Argic	17

Indeed Yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and Kahanists, right? Or they are exempt from condemnation, and allowed to hate? I know you'll answer me indirectly, it doesn't bother me a bit. Keep it up. Steel (who's never pissed off).	17

Neither your name nor your ideas, which I've come across before and thought were too stupid and uncivlized to respond to, prove your first-worldist claim and civility. Give me sources to read it or shut up. You think I will take such an ignorant as yourself on his words?? There is nothing primitive about Islam except in your mind. I do read and live daily with disagreable facts, and I only ask them to prove themselves. The last time I checked, this was truly a 1st-worldist civilized approach to facts and figures. I did not whine about the jews, I merely stated a fact thet is strange to nobody. As far as me being jerk, FUCK YOU. (Sorry to other people that read this). I am at home fuck face. my name does not mean I am from somewhere else, except in your litte manute stupid brain. And while we are at names, yours does not particularly seem to be 1st-worldist.

ED> ED> best regards from a Palestinian of Jewish origin who talks, reads and writes ED> Hebrew and does not hate Jews nor anybody else. ED> ED> Elias The above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite true. The falsity of this statement is easily visible in the intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in this group. Your complete lack of objectivity toward Israel, and Jewish identity in general, reveal biases that indicate a great steaming heap of hatred! You certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for objectivity. You repeatedly post items or quotes removed from their original context so that they can be used to further an agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of Israel. You have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image of several Israeli leaders. I can't say if you actually HATE these leaders, but the lies and misrepresentations of them do suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them. So, while you claim that you do not hate anybody, there is an ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is false. It is obvious that you hate Israel, and it is evident that you hate the Jewish people. And, if you are Jewish, you are a self-hating Jew. There can be no doubt of this. Although you will call upon your Jewish background in an effort to claim the high moral ground, there is no doubt that you would like to see the Jewish people fade away completely, as a people. Your advocacy of intermarriage for the purpose of dissolving the Jewish people is proof that you hate the Jewish people. And by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your own Jewishness on all Jews, you've clearly demonstrated to me that you hate yourself. * * * * "Who is a Jew? A person whose integrity decays when unmoved by the knowledge of wrong done to other people."	17
Elias Davidsson writes... ED> The following are quotations from Zionist leaders. They appear in ED> numerous scholarly works dealing with the Palestine question. I urge those ED> who have access to original sources, to verify the authenticity of the ED> source and post here their finding, adhering to the truth whatever it be. It is your responsibility for posting quotes in context. Your phony 'research center' is the source of the most unscholarly, out-of-context, agenda-ridden, and sophmoric propaganda that I have ever seen. Don't believe me, folks? Let's take a little stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson's contributions to our understanding of the middle east. ED> Quotations from Zionist leaders ED> 1. "There was no such thing as Palestinians" ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday ED> Times, 15 June 1969) And what do suggest that she meant by this? Do you think she meant that the Palestinians don't exist? Or does it actually mean that the people who self-identify as 'Palestinians,' did not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of Golda Meir? ED> 2. "There is, however, a difficulty from which the Zionist ED> dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it. ED> Palestine proper has already its inhabitants." ED> (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920, ED> p.88) When this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of the region were not all Jews. They are not all Jews now. No Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to be ONLY for Jews. That was true then. It is true now. ED> "[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs." ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to ED> the Knesset, ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the "Beasts", New ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982) Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot know what Begin was talking about. For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy Research,' you are not a very honest person. ED> "Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] ED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out ED> discreetly and circumspectly". ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, ED> 1960, I., p.88) Herzl died eighty nine years ago. Are you suggesting that he has stated what is Israel's policy today? Have you ever seen Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel? If you actually believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non- Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot. But if you realize that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis, then you are nothing but a common liar. This one time I will give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. ED> "We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any ED> employment in our own country" ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, ED> I, p.88) Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century. You do so within the context of modern day Israel. Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. How does this fact define the United States today? ED> "[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place" ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, ED> 1985, p. 89) Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this? This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became a state. It has no bearing on Israel. ED> "We must do everything to ensure they [the ED> Palestinian refugees] never do return" ED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in ED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, ED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157) YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees.' And by doing so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion, who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands, at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their homes. What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews were at war. ED> "The country was mostly an empty desert, with only ED> a few islands of Arab settlement" ED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David's ED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, ED> 1970, p.249) At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true, especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a few short decades. ED> "All this story about the danger of extermination [of ED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of ED> new Arab territories" ED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al ED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972) Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. ED> "Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can ED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat" ED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the ED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily ED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987 Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back. And what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab. ED> "The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab ED> workers is a cancer in our body" ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13 ED> December 1974) There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted of people from OUTSIDE Israel. It is a wise to be concerned. A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation for a country. ED> "There can be only one national home in Palestine, ED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership ED> between Jews and Arabs" ED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist ED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931, ED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, ED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135) This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years after this statement was made. Obviously times change. This is NOT what Israel is about today. I believe the peace talks make this quote irrelevant. ED> "There is not a single Jewish village in this country ED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village" ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha'aretz, 4 April 1969...) This is completely false. ED> "Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 ED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have ED> been prepared" ED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military ED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980) Expelled from where? Israel? The occupied territories? New Jersey? Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as to what on earth he was talking about. Obviously not. ED> "We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the ED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization ED> as opposed to barbarism." ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. ED> 29) Interesting notion. Considering that this was written nearly a century ago, it is quite visionary. ED> "I deeply believe in launching preventive war ED> against the Arab States without further hesitation. By ED> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the ED> annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion ED> of our territory" ED> (Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October ED> 1955) This was said nearly forty years ago. Begin is dead. And it should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist, it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it captured them. Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of them. ED> "During the last 100 years our people have been in a ED> process of building up the country and the nation, of ED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional ED> settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no ED> Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that ED> we are near the end of the road." ED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma'ariv, 7 July 1968) He's dead, too. And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all of these misleading quotes. They are so out of sync with the reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them. ED> "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian ED> Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue ED> against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in ED> their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, ED> we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in ED> which they and their forefathers have lived. We are a ED> generation of settlers, and without the steel helmet and ED> the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. Let ED> us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting ED> and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, ED> who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that ED> our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation, ED> the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong ED> and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our ED> first, and our life will be snuffed out." ED> (Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal ED> Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists, Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154) Interesting quote. It's true that we should never lose sight of the plight of these people. We should also recognize that this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues to this day.	17
Damned if you do and Damned if you don't! Just for the record, Egyptian troops were one of the first to be stationed there. I can't remember the exact date but it was late last year. In fact, they lost at least one man there as far as I know.	17

And this is just the beginning. Fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government will not get away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, and 204,000 Azeri people. Your criminal grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history. Your fascist grandparents admitted their unspeakable crimes then. Why deny them now? Now the genocide of the truth by the criminal/Nazi Armenians? Not a chance. Source: "Men Are Like That" by Leonard Ramsden Hartill. The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis (1926). (305 pages). (Memoirs of an Armenian officer who participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people) "Foreword:" "For example, we were camped one night in a half-ruined Tartar mosque, the most habitable building of a destroyed village, near the border of Persia and Russian Armenia. During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins." p. 202 (first and second paragraphs). "We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." p. 15 (second paragraph). "The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized." "I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility." p. 20 (second paragraph). "Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror, unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished." p. 109 (second paragraph). "As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means. The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days. The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was, as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts." p. 203 (first paragraph). "A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar's head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar's body, and, raising it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, 'Slodkey! Slodkey!' (Sweet.)" p. 203 (second paragraph). "One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children. The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the dead." p. 204 (first paragraph). "I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted. Guided by the child's crying, I entered the yard of a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a year old." p. 118. "Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms. Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot. Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety. This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene.... That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed." p. 192. "Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores that had been left by the Turks." p. 193. "Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country." p. 195. "The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians." p. 218. (First and second paragraphs) "Russian troops did terrible things in the Turkish villages...We Armenians did not spare the Tartars....If persisted in, the slaughtering of prisoners, the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course. I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground, in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep. They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands, and exchanging blow for blow. They had died as the helpless must, with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself." p. 133 (first paragraph) "In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw." p. 19 (first paragraph) "The Tartar section of the town no longer existed, except as a pile of ruins. It had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. The same fate befell the Tartar section of Khankandi." p. 22 (second paragraph) "Many of our men had served in the Russian Army, and were trained soldiers. We Armenians were rich and possessed arms. Tartars had never received military training. They were poor, and possessed few arms beyond knives. ...Shortly after the killing of the Tartars in our village, the revolution in Russia was suppressed." p. 97 (third paragraph) "Within a few years, following the beginning of the movement, an invisible government of Armenians by Armenians had been established in Turkish Armenia in armed opposition to the Turkish Government. This secret government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called 'Mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees." p. 98 (first paragraph) "The Dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the Turkish Government." p. 98 (third paragraph) "...the Dashnacks engineered a general revolt of Armenians in Turkish Armenia under the mistaken belief that European nations would intervene and secure independence for Turkish Armenia." p. 99 (second paragraph) "The Dashnacks were fanatics." p. 99 (third paragraph) "The Dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their revolutionary activities into the Russian province. They instituted a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing contributions to the party funds from rich Armenians. A wealthy man would be assessed a stipulated sum. Refusal to pay brought upon him a sentence of death. Every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without question. If a man were to be assassinated, lots might be drawn to select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the 'mauserists' of the party." p. 130 (first paragraph) "...in moments of victory against Turks and Kurds or Tartars, they [Armenians] have been remorseless in seeking vengeance." p. 130 (third paragraph) "The city was a scene of confusion and terror. During the early days of the war, when the Russian troops invaded Turkey, large numbers of the Turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the Russian advance." p. 159 (second paragraph) "I made a cannon, a huge gun to lift which required four men. I made balls for it. With my cannon the Armenians could knock down any of the Tartar houses and so they were able to drive the Tartars out." p. 181 (first paragraph) "The Tartar villages were in ruins." p. 189 (third paragraph) "The dead Tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood, his beard still setaceous and now crimsoned."

I hope, I hope, that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues and concerns related to this peace process. We have differing opinions, certainly, on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope that "resolution" of the tensions and conflict **will** happen. As we "run to the defense" of our side, there is no need to constantly involve ourselves in name-calling. All of us are regularly confused by the "other's" reactive posting because "they" spend most of the post applying "labels" and presenting slogans than in just presenting their honest views. Then...when we "react", we do the same thing. -------------=--------------------+-----------------------=----------- Do you, as I do, agree that this (sort) of "peace process" is needed? What about the particular points mentioned in the article? Is what Israel is (supposedly) going to propose "good"? Does it go too far? Not far enough? If you don't agree that a "peace process" is needed, what is?	17
There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall. That does not mean, however, that once can generalize from this to any other points. The entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them, and which had been denied to them for millenia. On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry.	17

Azerbaijan claimed that more than 1000 civilians massacred by Armenian forces. Serdar Argic	17
I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting them go. Israel has nothing to do with it. As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left in some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising perhaps just over a thousand (but I have lost the exact figure. Maybe someone will be so kind as to post it). There are communities left in Yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a free-ish election), Algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist intellectuals I think), of course Syria and Lebannon. The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries is controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into a dispute about it. Egypt expelled most of its community outright. Most of the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence. I think that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I am not sure. Someone else around here will know for sure. There are claims that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. It would take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France (as most did) or to Israel. Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel. Those left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing about it so I guess it was just a rumour. Any I left out except Iraq? Joseph Askew	17
dear pete, for one who is so zionist as you, you should at least know your hebrew, young man. The last sentence in your posting should read: Medina achat leshnai amim (not Echad medionnot leshtai amim). I don't want to address your comments. They speak for themselves. best regards from a Palestinian of Jewish origin who talks, reads and writes Hebrew and does not hate Jews nor anybody else.	17
There are doubts about it. Why don't you define what self-hating Jew means? I found the idea itself of being a self-hating Jew to be one of those rediculous things that people repeat and repeat because it seems to have a meaning when in fact it has none. I hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like: look at this person, that is a self-hating Jew. That is why I get moved when I see the Israeli Army killing people in the Occupied Territories as much as I get moved when I see a Plestinian stabing people in Israel.	17

In fact, this "productive human presence" in the desert has, in the centuries it has been there, produced one of the greatest civilizations in human history. They not only created the wheel, but the printing press, the light bulb, Post-Modern skyscraper architecture, Broadway theatre and nuclear power, as well. Right, Elias. The Negev was a veritable Garden of Eden until the Evil Jews turned off the rain and turned it into a horrible desert. Part of the International Jewish Conspiracy. Say, who should I call to turn off the rain here in NY, right now? Yeah, deserts rarely look like the Garden of Eden. This is why Nature Reserves people are heavily armed with anti-tank weaponry. Just what we need in the Nature Reserves. Nothing like "vast nuclear reactors" when it comes to hiding them from air attack. AT least Saddam had the sense to hide his CBN plants in "baby milk" factories. Indeed, many older people recall fondly those lovely tomatoes and oranges that the Bedouin exported form their Garden of Eden. In fact, that region used to supply the entire world with bananas, until the Jews pushed that business onto the "banana republics". Elias, you're stupid postings are a source of considerable amusement and hilarity. Please don't stop. I might even have to go back to watching TV.	17
Parts of Sen. Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today: Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary. You are required to speak diplomatically; I am not. I cannot even begin to express to you my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory. ... What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference, timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy. ... After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe havens' for the Bosnians... Let's not mince words. European policy is based on cultural and religious indifference, if not bigotry. And I think it's fair to say that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression instead of Serbian aggression. Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin to predict. Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out: I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear this is a big deal... so they will understand. and it IS a big deal. By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have aided the Serbian aggression. Moreover, the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined. Under such conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a "divide-and-conquer" game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe. One final quote: U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has said in Rome last week that "In practice, the embargo had the opposite effect intended. It made aggression certain." All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy.	17
Here you give positive, accurate "facts" about what happened to the beduins and the land: After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev, spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming. A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev. But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army. And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there: No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven "development towns", or *sowetos*, established for them. (the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email: elias@ismennt.is) So what you basically say is that "we know for sure that nothing good happens there now, we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews, noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there." Is that what you said? Could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote? BTW, try asking beduins in Sinai how they mis the Israelis. Not to mention that there are enough valotaring beduins in the IDF to have at least one full brigade of them.	17

I always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it (Will Durant ?), but I am beginning to believe the opposite is true. Here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. In the history of my own people there are ample acts of shame, both done by my people and done to my people. Since I was not party to any of those acts, I refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my ancestors committed, nor do I direct hatred toward the descendants of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors. Will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque? Will it rebuild the Temple? Somehow I doubt that it will. A post in another group, on the Bosnian war, asked us all to love each other, that love would conquer hate. Sadly, I remember a TV interview with a young woman in Sarajevo (sp?) who was as I remember, a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. She was now trying to pick-off Serbian snipers. During the communist years she had married a Serb, who was now fighting against her people. So it seems that hate will conquer love. Is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try and see how we might all live together? It's a damn small planet, which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball, glowing softly in space. We seem to have been spared that prospect, shall we now bathe it in each other's blood? Shalom, Salam, and Peace	17
So, the Greek educational system is also in a shambles. History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people. Again, the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus,' and save his flock from Ottoman rule. Source: "The 'Past' in Medieval and Modern Greek Culture," in Speros Vryonis, ed., 'Byzantina kai Metabyzantina,' Vol I (Malibu, Calif., 1978). p. 161. In the words of Professor Skiotis, "With savage jubilance, [the Greeks] sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea, nor in the whole world.' The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko' in the only way they knew how: through a war of religious extermination." Let me further improve this one for you. After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up, formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army. Now wait, there is more. <<The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities in the Peloponnesos, where the revolution erupted in 1821. The Jews, because of their close association with the Ottoman administration, were massacred along with the Turks. The Jewish communities of Mistras, Tripolis, and Kalamata were decimated; the few survivors moved north to settle in Chalkis and Volos, still under Ottoman rule. Patras lost its ancient Jewish community, which was refounded only in 1905.>> Nikos Stavroulakis 'Athens-Auschwitz', page ix. Source: Professor Stanford J. Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991). page 187: <<...the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire which had been going on for a century was disastrous for Ottoman Jewry. This was the age of nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all'. The success of the Greek national movement, provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>> page 188: <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence. Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity, soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past. Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies, by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive and damaging. The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>> page 188: <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence, their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries earlier. This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>> page 189: <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>> page 190 (second paragraph): <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>> page 190 (third paragraph): <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were massacred along with uncounted Turks [16]. Reverend John Hartley, after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18]. The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece, particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and Izmir [21].>> page 193 (last paragraph): <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians, Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century.>> page 194 (last paragraph): <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903, thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria. The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu, and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues, homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies: 'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe, all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of them were massacred in a single night....'[28] 'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of 6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and without even anything to wear is in despair. Everyone wants to emigrate...'[29] page 196: <<As a result of these assaults, massacres, and forced deportations from the independent countries of Southeastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire received literally thousands of Jewish refugees who joined the Muslims who survived the persecution, flooding into the Empire...>> [14] Shlomo Rozanes, Korot Hayehudim Beturkiyah Vebeartzot Hakedem: Hadorot Haachronim (Jerusalem, 1945), pp.42-44, cited Yitzchak Kerem, 'The Influence of Anti-Semitism on Jewish Immigration Patterns from Greece to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th Century', pp.2, 14.

It is the Serbs who were divided when Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina attempted to secede from Yugoslavia, ripping more than 2,000,000 Serbs and their property out of Yugoslavia. The Croatian and Muslim nations had the right to secede, not the Republics. Additionally, the secessions were to be negotiated, which would probably have required international mediation; instead the secessions were illegal, unilateral, and acts of war against Yugoslavia and those who did not want to be ripped out of Yugoslavia by the secessions.	17
And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from an unnamed source? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims with Nazi Armenians. Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in various units in the German Wehrmacht, according to Ara J. Berkian. 14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units, 6,000 in German army units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS.[1] A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France, Greece, Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit themselves to the German war effort. Derounian says that "Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion Armenienne.'"[2] That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service. [1] Enno Meyer, A. J. Berkian, 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax, 900 Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 118/119. [2] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), in 'The Armenian Displaced Persons,' ibid., p. 19. In fall 1942, the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed, to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. In the second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created. These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were attached to the infantry division 162. Also attached to ID 162 were the field battalions II/9, I/125 and I/198 which were formed between May 1942 and May 1943. Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army, if battalion II/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be included.[1] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers. Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien.' [1] Joachim Hoffmann, 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943, Turkotataren, Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer,' (Verlag Rombach Freiburg 1976), p. 172. While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War, Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat. They now backed Stalin's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces, hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim population would be exterminated. Stalin played on Armenian national sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America for his imperial ambitions.[1] Stalin's ultimatum to the Turkish government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine.

I really disagree with you. But maybe you know better. Here is the issue at hand: 'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?' (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), "The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi", p. 213.) "The crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination of the Muslim population in Soviet Republic of Armenia, Karabag, Bosnia and Herzegovina is an 'Islamic Holocaust' comparable to the extermination of 2.5 million Muslims by the Armenian Government during the WWI and of over 6 million European Jews during the WWII." (Tovfik Kasimov - Azeri Leader - September 25, 1992) "Today's ethnic cleansing policies by the Serbian dictatorship against Croatians and Muslims of Yugoslavia, as well as the Soviet Republic of Armenia's against the Muslim population of neighboring Azerbaijan, are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide perpetrated by the Armenian Government 78 years ago against the Turkish and Kurdish Muslims and Sephardic Jews living in these lands." (Cebbar Leygara - Kurdish Leader - October 13, 1992) Serdar Argic	17
You are not sticking to the original question. Imagine what it would be like if you were human...impossible you say? Is that not the crux of my argument? Why is this so difficult for you to understand? Lack of intelligence? Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? 1) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of Van.[1,2,3,4,5] 2) Armenians did slaughter 42% of Muslim population of Bitlis.[1,2,3,4] 3) Armenians did slaughter 31% of Muslim population of Erzurum.[1,2,3,4] 4) Armenians did slaughter 26% of Muslim population of Diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4] 5) Armenians did slaughter 16% of Muslim population of Mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4] 6) Armenians did slaughter 15% of Muslim population of Sivas.[1,2,3,4] 7) Armenians did slaughter the entire Muslim population of the x-Soviet Armenia.[1,2,3,4] 8)....

If that "culture" referred to is Israeli, being anti-zionist can be seen as a complete denial of that entity's right to exist and its "legitimacy". Just as saying that Islam has *no right* to establish and implement a "state" that includes any non-muslims, both are *absolute*, one-dimensional views of that culture with regard to the issue of "state". If that were the case, one would expect a few of that culture's positives to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand. Since the issue *centers* on Israeli culture, I have yet to hear of *any* positives of that culture in this discussion. I agree with you. But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture "disassembled", the first culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its "survival" as well as maintain its moral center. Since the culture is not about to turn away from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles, it has the virtually impossible job of "balancing". To discuss Israel's faults and "crimes" without *any* recognition of this circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant's political biases, NOT on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation. The same applies to those who attempt to paint the Palestinian movement as "all bad" and dispense with considerations of the *reality* facing them. You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of "self-hating" addresses the motivations. I certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating, distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it. Since bits of that culture are bound, due to his/her upbringing, to be a part of him/her, a bit of self- dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere. As you well know, this process of *blaming the other* for the morally questionable actions one side is forced (by the "other", of course) to take is thoroughly practiced by **both sides**. If you are only hearing the pro-Israeli crowd's self-supporting arguments, that may be due to the fact that you are not listening for anything else. *I* certainly hear the similarly distorting pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab element in *this* newsgroup (as well as in soc.culture.arabic). I agree, agree, agree, agree. However, in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson and those opposing his presentations, I saw Davidsson carefully putting academic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike- "them", yesIdo,yesIdo,yesIdo. I did *not* find the approach of those opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial of the "other side". I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson's views on the Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage. Having said this, however, I agree with you that this constant accusing others of being "self-hating" jews seems pointless. It is not worse a label than is "why, you're on their side", except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic biasedness. Tim	17
Throughout the years of the Israel/Arab-Palestinian conflict, the internal Palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the lower tiers of the economy. Given the major kinds of positions required by the Israeli and the "Palestinian" economy, there are essentially two different ones existing side by side aren't holding down many of the " skilled" positions. So, when Gaza has to operate on its own, there are few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.	17
The NY Times is in error. This is not simply my opinion; even the Arab sources that I use do not make this claim. This, of course, is assuming that the NY Times was refering to the islands that I named above. Of those islands, only Abu Musa has been in dispute and Iranian occupation of that island predates the existence of the UAE.	17

Some articles on the topic: RTw 12/23 0859 GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) By Youssef Azmeh ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit that restored their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran on Wednesday to reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council summit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that "rocked Gulf stability and security." The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements by Egypt, which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit. Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and Tehran's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind President Hosni Mubarak's mediation. The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs islands. Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against Iraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. They endorsed once again the "Damascus Declaration," a pact signed with Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year which would have helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the $10 billion agreed last year. The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help. Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos to create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man "Peninsula Shield" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a Saudi general. Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia next December. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/23 0835 GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day annual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three strategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for continued U.N. sanctions against Iraq. It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common market, but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran "is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region's states." It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it shares with the United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller islands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs. It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified Iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on Iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was "shaking peace and stability in the area." Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to exercise their authority over the whole island. The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement. REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/26 1441 IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on Saturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its eight-year war with Iraq. "Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of Iran," Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) said. A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council voiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings. Besides the UAE, the GCC also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's meeting on Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University: "Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood." The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received in Cyprus, also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as "irresponsible." "No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil," said the SNSC. Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to be close to the Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's self-restraint had certain limits. It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. "The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was "childish," Tehran Times said. IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which urged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull out of the two other islands. Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have historically belonged to it. The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.

I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3) something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be. Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to establish a police force for Haiti. I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it, nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved in internal conflicts. That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse lot - the UN (Security Council). And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship under the UN Sec.

Try coming up with your own definition of any or all "self-hating" peoples. To me, any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the absolute negatives of that culture (generally, or regarding a particular event) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture (thus, selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring of "context" results) "hate" their culture. That certainly describes Elias, since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian experience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis. And, this is precisely why Israeli society has been tremendously harmed by the actions it (its government) has *felt it had to take* in response to an "other" perceived as a threat. Just as with you, there has long been a strident and emotional debate about the pain Israelis feel when forced to "balance" desires for survival and moral beliefs. The trauma of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political debate) for the sake of the other, only reshaped.	17
I would change one of the many parts that define my cultural identity. If I loose a leg, it might change my personality, but I do not stop being a human being. Even more, when someone gets a baboon heart, that person is still human. Not really. That is what differenciates agnostics from atheists. As an atheist, I do not believe there is a god, nor do I believe that there ever was one. So, those commandments have no meaning to me. Also, there are a lot of ideas that have no meaning to me: The idea of a chosen people, the idea of a given right to the land of Israel, the idea of keeping kosher, the idea of opposing intermarriage, the idea of having a Torah that was inspired by god, etc. By being an atheist, I cannot support the idea of the Jewish Nation as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity. For me, religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural identity of the Jewish people. I believe that as a people with a cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as any other people in the world to have their own State. The same right as the Armenians have, as the Palestinians have, as the French have, and as anybody else have. I cannot say that by accepting a different god someone has lost all cultural identification.	17

Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the Jewish people. The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all. Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people. Arabs have been around for a long time. They already have some 2 dozen states, large and small, covering 98% of the Middle East. More specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs from the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt. One Palestinean state already exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called Jordan. There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean state out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as there is no justification in carving out another American state out of Mexico.	17

SOME Bosnian Muslims cooperated with the Nazis in World War 2. Other Bosnian Muslims risked their lifes to hide Jews from the Nazis and Ustashe, and those Jews who survived the war remember that. In fact the Jewish leader in Sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the Bosnian Muslims that saved so many Jewish lives in WW2. Similarly, SOME Serbs are "doing" to Muslims now. This is a group of serial-killers, rapists, and thieves who have control of the vast Yugoslav army arsenal. Many other Serbs oppose these atrocities.

If you look at the bottom of this article you will see that I have very kindly dug up one of Yigal Arens previous postings (entirely without his permission, I hope he doesn't mind) containing translations from Ha'arezt detailing just such a case. Perhaps you think that Ha'arezt lies? Would you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise *never* occurs? Right, Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long? And in all that time NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a Ministry? This is about as likely as sprouting wings and flying to Rio. What basis do you have for explaining this odd failure? You seem very confident that you are right, exactly how do you know, why are you sure? Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition members do the same? Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise? Hey what?? As I said even when their party puts them up they get knocked back. It surely couldn't be because they are Arabs is it? Well yes, but Security is the reason most often given by people who want to make excuses. I merely thought it would crop up and so pre-empted it. Start of Article (All commets in [*....*] are mine not Dr. Arens) [Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal] Racism in the Knesset --------------------- Coalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs from _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and his friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab public and their representatives in the Knesset. Although he did refuse to view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the government, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to "work towards a decrease in the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens". [Decrease WHAT?!?! But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist *at* *all*! Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal]. However, racism has not disappeared. When the Knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK from Hadash [the Communist party, one of the "Arab" parties - Yigal] on the State Comptroller's Committee. And oh, did that ever stir up a storm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house committees. "Security secrets" are liable to fall into their hands... This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism, being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people's hearts -- holds that there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of Israel. We are not speaking here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination. The proof: one of the compromises proposed was that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar Gojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party. It was not the member's party which was considered unfit, but his race... [* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *] It is worth noting that for the first time since the state's founding, a public debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following article: A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE By Gid'on Levi, Ha'aretz, July 26, 1992 Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them. [Do you hear that, -----? Please contact this Levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about Israel. Please! - Yigal]. Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's window dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious. Last week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more important committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories. Seemingly two entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same. The 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its members are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least on one issue. Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition endures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house. There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee. Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not "to give" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller's Committee. The arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an Arab should hear them. One must not make light of such arguments, but their significance should also not be exaggerated. Every Arab MK is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther headquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which could safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish Underground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from Hadash. The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee on Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK Nawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even a review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news. And what would happen if MK Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al-Najah? Their non-participation [in important committees] and that of their colleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the elected house have only semi-positions. They are good enough for addressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and Absorption Committee. But they must not, for example, participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities. In any case, they have little part in that. Labor's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about some improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the State Comptroller's Committee. Earlier, there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be, and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies, but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step. But not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices. The new Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee. Thus he will decide where it is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not. A solution such as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of the committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the Knesset.

It is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is interested in what I actually said, I never compared the Israeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust. Anyway that is the truth if it matters. I was about to forget about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic for making the comparison that I never made. What I did say was that the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now. The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the lebenese border. No trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on guilt due to race.	17
If he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several synagogues in the "Moslem Quarter", then the story becomes suspect... In reality, the Old City was not as neighborhooded in the past as it became after 1948. In pre-Israel Jerusalem, there were many Jews in what is now called the Moslem Quarter. There are postal and telephone directories from that time to prove it. It's really rather interesting to hear Arabs there claim that a house or store has been in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and documents that show a Jewish-owned business at the same location just a few decades ago.	17
From article <1993May12.111030@IASTATE.EDU>, by jakhan@IASTATE.EDU (Javed Ahmed Khan): First of all, this is NOT a strife; this is a massacre of innocent Moslem poeples by the Christian West. Since Ottoman lost the control of Balkans, many tens and hundereds of millions of Muslem peoples (Turks, Albanians, Bosnians, and others) have been tortured, raped, massacred, and driven out of their homes by the Cristians of both the region and Europe. Some lucky ones escaped to relative safety in Turkiye. The remaining others are being finished now by local Christians, the USA, and the rest of Europe. The Christian West is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the Muslem peoples of Bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting Christian Serbs and Croats torture, rape, and massacre the innocent Moslem peoples of Bosnia.	17
You are somewhat close to truth. But you shouldn't forget that nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. In the days of the Ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of difference between social classes. The Ottomans didn't recognize Turks, Arabs, Greeks, Serbs... Just christians, muslims, jews... So, for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the bosnian muslims were "Turks". After all, there aren't many "real" (ethnic) Turks living even in Turkey today. Even in Europe, it's the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of one's culture. Can you support this?	17
It has nothing to do with how long they have been voting, as much as HOW they have been voting. Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order. Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections. Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas. Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates. This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs. Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff. I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected. At the time, the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates. Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of the delegates. This is a power base that can not be ignored! Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again due to lack of political power). I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest. And to answer your question, I "broke" with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition members. Fair enough. My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument. If he was sitting on the committee, then someone else obviously would not be. In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf. As to the proof presented in this article, I would find it very interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup describing how the matter stands/was resolved. Let me just take this opportunity to say that I deplore such actions and groundless justifications. For the record, Roni Milo, is a brash MK (self described) from the Likud (note NOT LABOR). Quite frankly, I don't think anything he would say could surprise me. Annoy and aggravate, yes, surprise - no. Yes I do and thank you for providing it. I would be most interested in knowing how things turned out. Anyone......?	17
Arab citizens have the all the same rights as Jews. Arabs are exempt from military service, but that is about it. Arabs have a full voice in Israeli politics, to the degree that they choose to get involved. They may vote. There are Arabs in the Cabinet.	17

Smith means completely innocent people who were intentionally targeted, right? Please provide examples. Nice strawman. In _The Revolt_ Begin does state that the *myth* of a massacre at Deir Yassin may have had the effect of scaring some Arabs into fleeing. However, nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy of the Etzel. Thus, if it did happen, it was not so intended. I think Arab calls for Palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by Arab hands had a greater effecton Arab migration than Deir Yassin. In fact these jewish TERRORIST groups managed Really. Nice use of caps. I like it. Very effective. Actually, according to many sources, including American diplomatic officials, the greatest encouragment for Arabs to leave their villages came from Arab leaders.	17
Lovely arguments. But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that may lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others? DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years ago? More than how you treat the land and each other? Who is wise enough to decree that a person's right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth? Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise? IMHO, the American Indians have it right. We belong to the earth, it does not belong to us. Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around. My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk. Death and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins, disease vectors, lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies, nor any other way. When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others, "our" land and eventually ourselves. That is something of which to be proud. Very proud. Makes me glad to be human. I'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism. Maybe it's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce. But it's an artificial distinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to contribute to the next generation's legacy than anyone else? [In history the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive hardest. If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.] Then again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off. While I, of course, will make sure it doesn't happen, even if I must shoot Muslim infants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do so. That'll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the rightness of my cause. Clearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you. I would never get in the way of such fun. Let's see: soc.culture.turkish - Why don't you Turks go back to Lake Baikal where you came from, and leave the land to the Greeks, who stole it fair and square from the Scythians? soc.culture.pakistan - Why don't you guys redistribute yourselves over India, as God meant for you to do? soc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together, fight together, die together. We are brothers, and inseparable. talk.politics.mideast - oh well, had to be there.

[BH] Tsiel, [BH] I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border, [BH] starting from the early 70's. Certainly the PLO did shell Northern [BH] Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling [BH] destroying several South Lebanese villages. At the very least [BH] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional [BH] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages. [BH] In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in [BH] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false. Israel had [BH] many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government [BH] in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim [BH] with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin [BH] El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard [BH] to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel [BH] had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement. Basil, I was only correcting Steve's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel from the Golan, which was absurd. The fact that "Israel did much more shelling" was in response to Palestinian shelling from Lebanon. Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese territory. Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah, PLO, FPLP etc. as long as its northern border is not quiet. If the Lebanese army can control these elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border. I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to work. As for the election of Bashir Gemayel, it is true that he was favorable to Israel, is that why the Syrians killed him? His brother Amin was a Syrian puppet, if he had not been, he would have been dead by now. Tsiel	17
Do you have a problem with the language? I said everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the victims of Holocaust.

The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State Department propeganda. Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the British created Kuwait. They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands. The Kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle the dispute the old fashioned way... Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq together and concentrated on taking out Saddam. A strong, united Iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf. But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...	17
can anybody guess this from the title? Not me, I thought that a clash between Israelis and Arabs resulted in four deaths on one side and two on the other. How about being illegally settled there? I am not sure about the signals the Israelis are sending, one day they are willing to accept a Jordan/West Bank federation, the other they do not recognize the west bank as occupied territory (neither did the U.S, "the honest brocker") (details of the killings omitted, PLO,Hamas graffiti both claim responsability) Now don't tell me that this could not be an Israeli spy. We will know later. ********************************* Now the UPI shows its ugly face once and for all. USUALLY? It happened once this year, once last year. out of possibly thousands or more.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin? Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established, beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories. The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed. The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government. The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri, Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian. Source: "Bristol Papers", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.

Look up the facts first, post second. Bernadotte was assassinated in September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders (one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir). There is no hard evidence of complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN and other organizations (US intelligence, Swedish government) to find it. However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers. The Lehi man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend of David Ben-Gurion. The best published account in English is A. Ilan, Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989).	17

II., p. 188. "The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been confirmed with very accurate information, and the observations made by Rawlinson, the British representative in Erzurum, have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians. The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir's soldiers, hungry and miserable, their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir's troops and the people. When it was hoped that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered, many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives, and honour of the Muslims be protected."

Ofranko. Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist, Hamaza should take your drivel as a compliment. Furthermore, you even deny the obvious. There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government. Massacres of Muslims must be studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the horrible crime of genocide. Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims. The Turkish historic homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied by the x-Soviet Armenian Government. Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity. x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds. The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920.

"Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions, Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims. Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common soldiers began deserting in droves." "With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks, Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies."

"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."

"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead." Ohanus Appressian "Men Are Like That" p. 202.

In the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start that, I know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted the FBI. The FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in the head, and the medical examiner said "we have not seen evidence of this". At the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like typical medical examiner not releasing details until a thorough investigation. The medical examiner saying he hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying that it isn't there.	16

As David Veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be used against gun owners by the mass media. However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area, free, as a community service. Such a class would normally cost $40 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion. Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been very well received. We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns. We even get a few who are anti-gun, but feel they should know something about "gun safety" since members of their family keep guns at home. Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits: (1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. (2) A "gun safety" class is Politically Correct, and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media. (3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts) and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms. (4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense. (5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general. Our students see that we are all reasonable, non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner. Even anti-gun students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think about" with regards to personal gun ownership. (6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. Our course is the standard NRA-certified "Home Firearm Safety" class, and our students pay only $5 for materials. We also teach the NRA's "Personal Protection" class, although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs.	16

Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!) Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!) call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court. (ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often cross, damn I'm real sorry that rapist is dead! NOT!) an assailant with one shot. This, again, can be a real life saver in a hostile court. Be as cooperative with the police as possible! Show them where you were. Repeat your information as often as requested. They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts, and ,unfortunately, to see if your lying. Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits (BOOO! Down with registered citizens!Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated!) If they are required in your state. Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed. If you cannot afford one, contact the NRA. They have a legal assistance fund.(Or at least they used to) I DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER! (Not my business either way though..) If I was vague on anything, or I left some questions unanswered, you can E-MAIL me or post here. (Preferebly E-MAIL. I don't have a load of time to review the news) Kane	16
Not necessarily. If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate. In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up such scenes. As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the evidence. Texas Rangers are not pathologists.	16
True. No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder. Two years ago this month my house and office burned. In my office was my reloading bench. On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20 and .308. The fire was extinguished before the area containing the reloading supplies were fully involved. There was about 1/2" of char on the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting. Lots of heat in other words. None of the powder kegs ignited. One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited. No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids completely melted and ran down inside. The smokless powder was contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs. The kegs were charred badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away. Many of the rounds cooked off. They were in close proximity to wood on all sides so the effects were easy to observe. In most cases with the rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle. Many bullets were found still in the neck. Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into the wood. Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually dislodge them. Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard. Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless of what the FBI says. John	16
[many lines deleted] Ah, here Freeman is being prejudiced (look it up and see what I mean Freeman). Here Freeman is pre-judging someone before he knows all of the facts. Guess it can happen to the best (and in his case the worst) of us. Freeman thinks I am behind when actually I am quite on top of things. The point he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be very tedious and ridiculous. See Freeman's next post for an explanation.	16
Sorry Charles...According to the National Safety Council, ACCIDENT FACTS,1991 "In 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children ages 14 and under." That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it. A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.???????????????? So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease, chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes. Oh, okay Charles, that makes a lot of sense. I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death. And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes. Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles. I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group? This is talk.politics.guns. Don't confuse the issue. Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another, we should not try to address it? I don't agree. I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it. Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes. The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority. I guess, maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined as "a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths." If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational. Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts. But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, "Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990" Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you? They state that "Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents, suicides, and homicides. Many more are wounded". Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry? They say "Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990." Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles??? They state that "Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from 1986 to 1988." Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns. If you don't realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you. Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion. I really don't want to do that. Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC. They don't just study cancer and heart disease. I've got news for you, interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic. In 1984, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents. WHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE FIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1 sentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here??? You're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn't. Charles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this. Do you live on the planet Mars??? As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools. In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids. Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot, whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and whether they themselves have ever been shot. Believe me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.	16
While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789. Moreover, "controlled" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling. Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a "well-regulated militia", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT under the control of govt. The wigged gents who argued about the constituion used it in that way. Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than "individual right, not to be interfered with by govt". Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on govt military power. See Scarry's University of Penn law review article for an extended discussion. The existence of a well-regulated militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient. -andy	16
Just want to make a comment on this. If you live in this country long enough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt. I am only concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion before the facts. But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as well; afterall, they like the controversial events, which of course make news.	16
That was a reasonable insertion, so folks would know "Random" hadn't made an error reposting your message. No one was flaming you for the typo.

Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some additional information. I called my state rep (to express my support), and the person there informed me that it's actually just a second reading of the bill (three are required) for further consideration. I'm not 100% sure what *that* means, and I'm also not sure why there's a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me. Still researching.... Daryl	16
And you'd be wrong about that too. Note that Texas isn't unique in this "more with-gun deaths than with-car deaths", but some of the other states where it happens have extremely strict gun laws. Oops - so much for the "meaning". It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car accidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're going to make it, let's at least be honest. Give it up for what? Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so it fails by this standard. Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't. That's half the question - the rest is "and what do you get for your sacrifice". If the answer to the second question is "nothing", as it is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified. -andy	16

CNN reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their heads. However, I have no information on the possible causes. This is not to say that Government stories are to be taken at the face value in this case, but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of embarrassment in the future. Let's be paranoic, this may be a ploy to smoke out the opposition and decredit them. :-) Comparison of this incidence to Tienanmen Square is made in soc.culture.china. Just in case you need more ammunition to shoot at each other. :-) No matter which side you are on this Waco issue, are you ready to die defending your cause? Peace be with you.	16
Did anyone else notice how the question of what federal laws were violated was brushed aside? I'd like to know what laws were violated, and on what evidence the orignial BATF warrants were based.	16
hello, I just want to make 2 points: 1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence, education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't believe it. 2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of Koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any FBI video is because it is: 1) classified 2) too gruesome for our eyes 3) lost/got coffee spilled on it Dwayne Jacques Fontenot	16
.. funny, if Koresh did say that, he was quoting St. Paul. of course, the early Christians were persecuted too. if Koresh is a loony because he quotes the Bible, how long is it before mainstream Christians become the target of the FBI's loving care and attention? jason	16
Well, that was an easy decision. No more Bianchi anything for me.	16
I guess you need to be reminded of some things! Have you ever heard of the First Amendment? I guess not. It isn't a crime to be a religous (I know you said "sacraligious", but it isn't your place to judge his religion) zealot in this country. REMEMBER we have freedom of religion in this country! I guess you are selective in that respect! So what if they were "bastard" children. They were CHILDREN! Do you condone their deaths? I pray for your lack of a soul if you do!	16
Generally the ship sinks (sorry, there's a picture of the USS Iowa next to my desk). First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter. Unless that expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice "pop" and not enough threat for even firefighters to worry about. Finally, it's rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to a crisp. See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were quite dead. Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising. However, it's my contention that it makes little difference whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem to have shared responsibility for both.	16
This is my first time on the network, but I am very concerned with this incident in Waco. I will refrain from stating my opinions until after I have read the FAQ. Could someone tell me how to get this? I must say that I believe the Govt. was wrong in the actions that they took in this situation.	16
It is not a matter of dis-belief but a matter of which of their constantly (and radically) changing stories we are to believe. Steve B.	16
I don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is pretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath. Of course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged things to get away from it. I've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill sergeants to get out of tents full of it. Which raises another issue.... What they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do TOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity to infants. On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are GREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient quantity of CS will displace OXYGEN. When running a CS chamber CAREFUL attention is paid to ventilation. I wonder if they checked to see if any of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory diseases. I doubt it.	16

You are correct WRT the idea of some heating being nice that morning. But part of that line was also for the guy who said "minutes later, the fires started". I did forget how cool it was that day.

Or, did anyone notice that when Clinton referred to the Davidians as 'religious fanatics' that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from the reporters ? To me this was not only in poor taste, but it showed the media's bias and hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe. No wonder they have been cheerleading for the kgBATF and the FBI during this whole affair.

This is where Freeman's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous. [his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people to carry concealed in Illinois] I did read the law before I commented on it. Judging from replies I received about my "Semantics on t.p.g" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one. It would also follow that said person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or business. Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant. The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere. I'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I am not taking into account city ordinances). I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home. I only care about the fact that I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street. Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense. I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore. The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are "running around in circles" trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore. Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do. My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some- times.	16
This was not stated nor implied. Try asking. This is laughable. Licenses? Right. So then I would need a license to possess chlorine gas? It is a weapons grade poison. Would I be breaking the law then if I were to, say, pour Chlorox on the spot where my cat pissed on the floor? The reaction of ammonia and bleach liberates pure chlorine gas. Do I go to jail for this? Why or why not? Would I need a license to possess other chemical agents? What about nicotine? Deadly poison, and rather fast acting. Must I now become licensed to posess tobacco? And what about nicotine sulphate, an even deadlier poison? Will I need a license to possess this type of insecticide? What about Raid(tm)? Black Flag? Gasoline? Benzene? Hydrazine (a violent poison)? Will I go to jail for possessing a can of tomatoes that went bad with botulinus? What about my mom & pop QC lab where I use cyanogen bromide (mustard gas) to do lot analysis on certain non-prescription pharmaceuticals? What if I wish to use potassium cyanide to recover gold from aqua regia? A license? Would I need a license to possess Beryllium, perhaps the most poisonous non-radioactive metal? How about Beryllium-Copper alloy? Do I need a license for nitrate fertilizers which *could* be used to make VERY powerful explosive devices such as the one that the IRA recently detonated, killing 1 and injuring 45? Can I have vinegar without license? Hydrogen peroxide? Where is the line drawn?	16
I understand fire trucks had been at the site for several weeks but were sent home three or four days before the assault. Can anyone confirm this?	16

Feel free to patronize me all you like; I need the tips. :-) Seriously, if you were insulted, I apologize. People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the things the government says are plausible. Especially if they refuse to consider reasonable alternatives. However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's no longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the government's party line. It looks like our "independent press" may actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance. This, to me, is a good sign. I hope it continues. Independent thinkers question authority. In a situation where only one set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability to challenge those "facts" critically. The scientific method consists of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing between two hypotheses that other people have proposed. --	16
You're sitting in your home reading a good book. Your neighbors think you're a quiet, upstanding citizen. A random person anonymously calls the authorities and tells them you beat your children, sleep with all the neighbor wimmen, and own a bunch of "nasty 50mm machine guns." Now what are they supposed to do? Ah, I see. They're supposed to send 100 men in horse trailers with automatic weapons, storm onto your roof, and throw grenades at your house with no warning. Then, after subjecting you to noise torture and telling the national news media for a month what a filthy son of a bitch you are, they're supposed to gas you and knock your house around a bit until they manage to collapse it, cause a fire, or something equally conclusive. Hope your neighbors don't tumble to this -- at least none of them that might have a craving for a ringside seat at some cheap but dramatic local entertainment at someone else's expense. Or maybe even PARTICULARLY at your expense. At least they won't have to read you your rights, Joe -- obviously you had no use for them anyway. --	16
This is the AP story from Fri morning. As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped. This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out. They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors. Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air, driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house, it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others died groping in the blackness.	16
Here goes: More than a few years back (if you were born that year, you can legally drink), we tried it out. We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft. 2X6s. We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans) stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom. After lighting the fire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can. We heard pops, one solid bang and several "fizzzz shussss". After we thought the excitment was over, we boldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all died of smoke inhalation. And 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers!	16
STOP IT!!!! ENOUGH!!! I'm out of there! I mean, I'm a relatively sane person. God knows I'm weak and will forgive me. But I'm not stupid enough to stay in this place any longer. I WANT OUT!!! Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me. Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs, is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never know...	16
Relay of coverage seen: ---------------------- There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier today (Wednesday). It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission. It was explained to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!) The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines. It was also emphasized that the survey of the "crime" scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere. The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case. That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory. I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it. It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. My opinions: ----------- I find this disturbing. While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize. Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me. It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair. I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months. Please also note that I by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups. As usual, I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO. As such, my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available. Scott Roby Standard Disclaimer	16
Once again, Koresh closed the door on an agent with a search warrant, and the door was then perforated by a rain of bullets from the inside. They shot first.	16
Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference. They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local calls could get through. ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the standard "pool shot"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast. Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the "theories" floating around the net. Score 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians. Or is that -89 Branch Davidians?	16
I tend to agree, but I would like a better explanation of why the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. I saw this in realtime. It concerns me that the FBI "appeared" to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started, and actually started flying hueys around the compound, which had to add in some small part to the winds driving the fire.

american and european universities were full of Angry Young People(tm) that wanted to overthrow the government, and wouldn't think twice about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the national guard (military police in Europe.) Certainly, it would have been very bad form to take anything the System(tm) said at face value. This was in the end of the sixties and the begining of the seventies, I'm told. I was too young to remember. Something wrong happened along the way, I'm afraid. Maybe the west became just too comfortable, or maybe I was born too late :( Yours, disappointed with with the youth of today, PS: 1) Half smilies implied. 2) There *is* a difference between lining up 90 people against the wall and executing them, and causing their deaths through negligence/ imcompetence. I honestly hope we witnessed the latter. As they say, the alternative is too horrible to contemplate. 3) I'm sure the Abused Children(tm) from the compound are much safer now. --	16
Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have wondered, "If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?" The answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the chemical weapons treaty. The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including nnocent children. For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George Stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations. (When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty did not forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This posting from Stephen F.

...... When did Koresh go on a rampage? What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th. Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable. And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately. They don`t believe Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack. I suppose they also believed things like: "I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget." "We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...." "It starts with a middle-class tax cut..." "I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history." "I will ask congress for a line item veto.." "I will lift the social security earnings test.." I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves right, rather than the other way around. That way I have a better than 50% chance of being right about my first guess! Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens and their rights. I am sick of the abuse of government power.	16
Very narrow. Very, very narrow. If you'll recall, I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations. How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what isn't is only the start of this. And you've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered. Reactors blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant. See what a can of worms this is? Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon. Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years. With the PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future. So your definition is flawed in a few respects already. Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed. If you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus. Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild. And I can show where any such gas has other uses. For example, perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers. Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas. It can be used for welding, in miners lamps, for gassing gophers, or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing. Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance. So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I still have those pesky gophers. The basis for, but I'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law, it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good. It is under your proposed law. So is a silage pit if there is run-off. So are underground fuel tanks. It meets all the criterion of a weapon. It is an instrument that can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose, and despite there being better weapons around. Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass destruction is rather a given. It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not see a lot of people having. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some pretext or another. The looser your definition, the more ripe for abuse that law is. Furthermore, if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law. Again, ripe for abuse.	16
The FBI has claimed from the begining that it wasn't standard use tear gas. How do you know it was? Or do you just assume it was for flamebait?	16
But of course it does. It's certainly a legal matter. If it's not a legal matter that interest *you* you may simply put it in your kill file.	16
I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and the story was quite detailed).	16
No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State. At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all. The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students. Some students were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting. The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil). At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in the confrontation. There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around. The governor of Ohio, James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in. The matter was quickly covered up. Some years later, wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).	16
Hey dude you are making me paranoid! What an argument!!! No, Frank Crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people are sane, normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. USEnet as a whole disproves it of humanity as a whole. We now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer. Buy a lot of guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn down your house. See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons to support gun control.

pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization rules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the text is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended). Then you didn't understand my grumble... Again, I said to get a CORRECT version of the Constitution. The first indicator that something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern capitalization rules.

Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay, what have we learned? For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for "straightening out the mess" -- and, more importantly, to script his side of the subsequent "negotiations" any way they please. The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: blame the victim. He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being "examined" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty. A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the system, then at least within yourself. On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that plank. True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, Waco never would have happened. Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote. Think about it. L.

After seeing William Sessions on television, explaining the great lengths to which the FBI went to determine the suicidal tendancies of David Koresh, I got the very unpleasent feeling that Koresh had manipulated the FBI's perceptions much the way he manipulated his own followers. Maybe I was manipulated by the news story.	16
Indeed. Larry King had the two attorneys (whose clients are now dead) of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night. Their discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account. The attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns in the compound which started the fires. Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other throughout this whole affair. I'll wait for some better evidence before I form an opinion. -- paul hager hagerp@moose.cs.indiana.edu	16
The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end. After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G. type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph, and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it. The text follows. The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess... (The title was the only thing they changed/added) "Gun Stats" The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley, author of "Armed and Female." The article, in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. The article states, "A study... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." This is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons, outlined below: The study gives the impression that, if you own a gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you. The study, however, fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe- trator. The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather than 'friend'. This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every month, the second your grandmother cashes her social security check. Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a friend. The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense. Especially considering the small sample size (396), taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted. Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be used, successfully, by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. Further, per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means, or who offer no resistance at all. Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide. It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them. D.F.

But this is all gun control laws end up doing. Politicians can never manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally. Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION licensed gun owners in Massachusetts. In the past year, the number of licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX. Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year. Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY obeying laws pay any dividents? So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators. See, this is what I call the "argument from religion:" "I believe." Don't believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith. Go look at the history of countries that passed gun restrictions. Pay particular attention to whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER after. (Don't look at "violent gun crimes," that's begging the question.) You may be very surprised. You have this absolutely backwards. If crime stopped in the presence of strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it. However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted. Think about it. So far, none of the stats show any improvement... Do you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity for having accidents? I've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while drunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the back seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on makeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone. But that's what they're doing when they have those accidents. How can anything that has no positive effect at all ever be "necessary?" And it didn't help, any of it.

It would have at least implied that you had some backbone, perhaps a modicum of willingness to present your views and support them. I guess we all know better now. Really? That's interesting, as I was always of the opinion that people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that they get. Dunkirk, for example. What? That has nothing to do with it? Then enjoy your helping of foot. And they killed a few people of their own, including one child at last report. So what? Being a federal agent is not license to kill. Then there's CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people. If you're so hot to assign blame, make sure you don't overlook the obvious. Montgomery isn't much of a hero here, either. Amazing how different things look on the other side of the pond, isn't it?

While dedicating the Holocaust Memorial Museum, President Clinton remarked: ``The evil represented in this museum is incontestable, but as we are its witness, so must we remain its adversary in the world in which we live, so we must stop the fabricators of history and the bullies as well." Clinton made this comment shortly after giving Janet Reno the go-ahead to hastily construct a gas chamber and crematorium in Waco... on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw uprising. Say, wasn't Monday also the anniversary of Paul Revere's ride? Is that a clue?	16
I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two. As far as I am concerned, I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise. The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL exposure. Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally, in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all. And even then, they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded "national exposure," but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it. The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript. We'll never know if he would have kept that one. Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to "wait as long as it takes." Quite possible. But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and negligent manslaughter. This would be an interesting development. It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to "go state's evidence," parrot the FBI story, hang the whole "suicide" on Koresh, claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc. If any of them do this in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is dead wrong. --	16
<Endless remarks of how the Davidians could have surrendered deleted.> If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths?? I thought thier neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them. Oh, well, that couldn't have been your point, then. If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt threatened and had to move in. Here's a newsflash: It isn't illegal to own more than one firearm. It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms. They shot federales? The feds shot them, too. How about that staying inside thing? Here's another newsflash: sometimes the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve. Since they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round, I can see why the Davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were expecting the end of the world. -- Andrew Diederich diederic@spot.colorado.edu	16
NO SURRENDER! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The mugger...the rapist. And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and always, there's the implied question "what's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you? But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10 years to devote learning judo? What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that "rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for robbery/assault)(Kleck,123) What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the whole community. As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves? Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says "no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out." But if a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified. "Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!" they ask. How could you hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from you. In truth, 1% of "defensive gun uses" result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck) Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense. We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist. That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed people. It's the way they survive. In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides "it's for your own safety" or "we know best". Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender. But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt me? Then why did you file your income tax? Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff, Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices given to women: to surrender or to fight. Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson: "the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots." As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write, and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it can lead to Tiananmen Square. When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future, I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick.	16

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied. Some cites: --------------------------------------- A recent BATF study (titled "Protecting America, Yes") surveyed 471 career criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers. --------------------------------------- National Institute of Justice Research in Brief November 1986 The Armed Criminal in America by James D. Wright (1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders. Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer. The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates, family members, and various black market outlets. The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and often theft. The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply. --------------------------------------- INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway #101 Golden, CO 80401 (303) 279-6536 WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY By David B. Kopel The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville. The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals.[51] In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers. 51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of 20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions; of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted) (of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted). --------------------------------------- INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No. 12-91 THE ASSAULT WEAPON PANIC: POLITICAL CORRECTNESS" TAKES AIM AT THE CONSTITUTION By Eric Morgan and David Kopel Testimony before Congress revealed that most "assault weapons" in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97} The testimony is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns, and leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98} Not surprisingly, Wright believes that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99} He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business.{100} 6. _See, _e.g., The Anti-drug, Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989.

Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end. Any generators are no doubt out of fuel, too. So all they would have is wood stoves and kerosene lanters (maybe). It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire. Remember, the FBI had bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private conversations with the lawyers. If a suicide order were given they WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME. If the Feds had been concerned they would have had emergency equipment ready. Not an hour or so later, not leaving the water THEY TURNED OFF, off. They could have turned it back on.

My god, a sane person! Somebody asking intelligent questions rather than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi Germany. I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF. There are some definite questions needing answers. Probably. Which is why there are so many people angry at the initial confrontation. Why attack a compound with as many people in that compound who are willing to die for their leader? Further, they attacked in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc. That was rather stupid... This I doubt. While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single exception of the psychological "warfare" by blaring music, etc. I think that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome. See above... Agreed. Which is actually rather refreshing nowadays. Most of the time, the higher-ups claim "I don't remember..." or "I had no involvement..." :-)	16

In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with people from this group. In particular, we discussed how cults operate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations. I include an edited account of what I wrote. The identity of my correspondents have (I hope) been erased. The editing process makes the text choppy - sorry about that. I've tried to retain the information content. Ellipses (...) indicate where text was removed. A few of the comments in parentheses are new, intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand. These notes are preliminary - feel free to criticize. Cheers(?), Oded ------------------------ (begin included text) ----------------------- I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ... The course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown. (Did some external reading too). William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of "evil" mass movements... starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY, University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII, and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ... I don't think the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced ..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume. So I think they're onto something. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- How cult psychology works... [I'm an amateur. Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.] So long as Koresh could "own" his people, he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them, away from him. Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing. During the siege, ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls. Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ... As long as they believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out. After all, if they ever left him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful) couldn't save them for a second. If I believed it, I'd stay and die too, like the folks in Jonestown. For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife (or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then themselves. That's the consequence of shattered "cultism." It really does happen all the time. [By the way, the treasured ideal in such cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.] ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?] I agree that official explanations are in order. I can also see good (?) reasons for news blackouts. ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence. Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted. He held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing would really stop him from offing them. Even if the FBI went away! Look at history. Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown, at the request of constituents who had relatives there. Once Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd be busted. Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down. There are tapes... The "logic" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour. I suspect it's the same with the Branch Davidians. (There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL. I don't know whether it's good - never read it.) ... The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... So, the only way the BATF/FBI could "save" those people, and future cults, is by ignoring such signs. I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go, or somehow influencing "his" people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. ... a mighty tough row to hoe. ... I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults. However, maybe they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible. It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk. ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after] ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed. ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ... I _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed. ... I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all. (the end) ----------------------------------------------------------------------	16
For those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out: "Also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents, including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities planned to use when the siege was over. "These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had in late February, which to this day have never been released. "...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused 'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly the ATF.'" So, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he expressed hostility to the BATF. That chilly feeling in your gonads is perfectly normal, folks... it should go away in about 51 days. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Murderous, huh? Yeah, there was all sorts of carnage going on there in the 60 YEARS they were there -- BEFORE the government assaulted them. Oh, I forgot -- you probably consider self-defense as murder. Damn right. This is not a partisan thing; it's about individual liberties -- the right of a citizen to be left the hell alone. That's another indication that you don't understand the issue. "Our appropriations are coming up soon. We need a good PR boost. Let's find a socially unpopular group who happen to have a lot of guns, go in like gangbusters, be heros, and have the local media get it all on video tape. Then we won't have to worry about our budget until next year." Why don't you knit one to match his jogging outfit? --	16
Well, we're not. Which goes to prove you still don't understand what we're saying here.

Has anyone considered how to prosecute a city holding a "no questions asked" buy-back for receiving stolen property?	16
And you shouldn't, as the matches kill more kids. So why are you bleating about guns? It may be tired, but it is true. No, that's not right either. People who have both easy access and the desire to kill, kill people. Considering that people who have the desire to kill turn that into easy access .... (Haven't you folks learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?) If you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to mention the other costs incurred. Good for them. I note that the TM folks make the same argument. If you'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city), they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc. At least they're not promising to jail me if I don't go along with their little plan - they're going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone. Ah, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it doesn't work to reduce crime. What is the point? We can't claim that it is symbolic, as people do get jailed. No, they're essentially saying "we hope this will keep you from noticing that we're not doing anything useful". Pissing away resources isn't "caring". Nope, you'll merely be ignored, as Wright, Rossi, and Daly were after finishing "Under the Gun". They were supposed to prove that gun control worked, so .... So, who gassed them? Given their previous experience with thugs who threw grenades before yelling "we're from the govt and we're here to help you", would a rational person think that the feds had their best interests at heart? Would you "know" that the gas was "non-lethal"? -andy	16
Here are a few ideas: 1) a free library card so they can look up the FBI Uniform Crime Report which shows how good HCI is at lying through their teeth, 2) a free RTD Transit Pass which will allow anti-gunners to tour South Central Los Angeles and convince people living there that they don't need guns to protect themselves because the police will do it for them (don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out), 3) a free bus ride to Vermont, which has almost no gun control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either, 4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore been unable to figure out what a small percentage of the guns owned in America are used to commit violent crime. -------------------------------------------------------------- Lee Gaucher NRA | My opinions. gaucher@sam.cchem.berkeley.edu | No one else's.	16
Funny, Brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the "facts:" 1) What the government says. This includes what the government says that two survivors have said. 2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says, including what he says that most of the survivors have said. Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars. If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in. I may have missed it. But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like case 2, and not at all like case 1. --	16

I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense "not real" leaves me uneasy. It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real. The tree outside my window is in this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree itself. The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have made of atoms. Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms. I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time. Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either. One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field. What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring. Anyway, if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think, it worked. After doing so, I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion if anyone cares:	0
Could you speak up? I can't hear you.... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------	0
Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally (not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different opinion on a matter of little practical importance. Sorry, but that doesn't help. What test will you apply to decide whether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking? How will you know that you have not simply gone insane, or having delusions? You are like a loaded gun. Ah, you not as stupid as I assumed. :-) Yes. We're all in this together - each human making up a small part of the definition of humanity.	0
No wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim. It is good to remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination. It is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer. Not unlike the rest of your arguments. I am extremely wary of the way you use words. Like in this case, there are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by themselves and others theists. I have pointed to that in my post. You use one of them. Your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my moral is objective/absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond of, everybody will know it, and there is no need to define it more exactly. And as a user has shown recently, the easiest way to dispell you is to ask you for definitions.	0
I don't have a stat, but, unfortunately, I did read generally that both smoking and belief in the supernatural (occultish garbage) is on the rise here. This is very interesting.

Whether the idea is christian or atheist doesn't always matter. But I'd like to say it's because atheists are more intelligent :) -- regards, --Adam	0
I asked around in one of the areas you suggested yourself, and presented the information I got. No mention of US landmines was given. Okay, so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable evidence? I didn't realize you were a theist. I am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it. If you are able to present real evidence for it, then great. But unsupported claims, or even claims by such and such news agency will not be accepted. If you want to stick to the sheer impossible, instead of the merely difficult, then fine. The statement that if such a fact is classified, then you can't prove it, is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law. If you have access to classified information that you know to be classified, and you reveal it, there is a good chance that you or someone else (the person who revealed it to you), is going to jail. I never said that you couldn't prove it to my satisfaction, I merely said that it was difficult.

Wow! You got me thinking now! This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously "socially unacceptable" yet legal activities as OK. In the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control. First (and most explicit) is legal control. That is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments. Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control. These are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure. The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as "guilt" and "morality". I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be absolutely impossible. Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't illegal, then don't pick on me). I'm not saying this is wrong, merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has: 1) A high education level, 2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media, 3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and 4) A "me" oriented culture. I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\ can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don't impinge on another's. IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here. While we appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society. I got no quick fix. I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess. I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms in order to "stabilize" society. Yet I believe development of societies follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability. Can we find a social model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable? Perhaps it is possible to live with a "non-stable" society? Anybody see a way out? Comments? PS. Therefore answer to question #3: We don't. Do we want to? Phil Trodwell	0
: The willingness of true believers : to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is : well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little. It does say something about the depth of their belief. Religion has both deluded believers and con men. The difference is often how far they will follow their beliefs. I have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the original apostles died. If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting it for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be inconsistent. Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would lead to discomfort, pain and death.	0
Well I agree with you in the sense that they have no "moral" right to inflict these rules, but there is one thing I might add: at the very least, almost everybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a herd morality, then so be it. Right, and since they grew up and learned around us, they have some idea of our right and wrong, which I think must, in part, be incorporated.

In <1993Apr20.004119.6119@cnsvax.uwec.edu> nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu (David Nye) Why? How? Might makes right? How can they force their morality on me? Why can't I do what I want? Who are they to decide? What if I disagree? Good point, but it is being immoral in our opinion. We don't let them choose, we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them. For someone to lay claim to an alternative I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense, but have little basis for it as of yet. How far can such a concept be extended? and Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but not him. After all, he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he chose. On what basis do we condemn other societies besides, here's the buzz words, on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all societies?

I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here on the net. The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief. I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu. First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours, I'm sure. As much detail as you want to give me (I mean it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration. Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that phrases like "What would convince you of the existence of God" imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens. In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my use of "God" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier than just repeating "a deity or higher power" every time. Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like "belief system" although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but are skeptical towards everything. I understand; but you know what I mean. Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across. Lastly, thanks! Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as you can, and send them to me. My research and I thank you. --------------- Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism? Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs. In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised? Did you ever believe in the existence of a God? (Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is "yes;" if you've always been an atheist, or at least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.) How serious was your/your family's involvement? How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe? How and when did your "final break" with your beliefs, if any, occur? I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an "event" per se; whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish. What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during) your "conversion" to atheism? (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?) To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs? Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means? Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)? To what extent do you feel you "understand" the universe through your beliefs? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as an explanatory method? What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs? What would convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the plausibility of God's existence, and so forth? How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for some time? Are you involved in a career or education in science? To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs? (Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new "secular religion," and that "scientists are, in a very real sense, the new priesthood." Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi- religious base, or even a religious element?) --------------- This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me. Would you be willing to have me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your beliefs? If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great. --------------- Thanks again. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what I've asked about above.	0
This response originally fell into a bit bucket. I'm reposting it just so Bill doesn't think I'm ignoring him. Bill, I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to this. Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ. Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack of an absolute moral system. However, I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions. An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according to a personal understanding of morality. That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one. I'm just explicit, as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists. So when I say that I object to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds. If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving considerable survival advantages. You'd probably say that God just made the rules. Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a common understanding about many moral issues. You think you get it from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early childhood teaching. I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying. I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as "God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites" is mechanistic, but of course I think that's true of you as well. My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him good, which is supposedly an attribute of God. Hmm. Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good. I have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person. In fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal. An absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion. The attempt to define someone or a group of people as "excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", and their opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right, wrong, and the Bible. -- Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

No, I spent a month just reading, too, mainly because I did not know much about the way atheists think. I even printed out the FAQs and discussed it with a friend before I started posting. Alt.atheism deals with religious issues (more appropriately, lack of religious beliefs), which are by their very nature very controversial. It makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make sure you are not repeating something others have said better. Petri	0
I bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British Government banning it. There's nothing interests me in a book more than making it illegal. However, it's still sitting on my shelf unread. Perhaps I'll get round to it soon. I've still got a pile of Lem, Bulgakov and Zamyatin to go through; I don't find nearly enough time to read. In fact, there are far more interesting things to do than I can ever find time for; how anyone ever manages to be bored is beyond me. If I didn't have to sleep, maybe I could manage it. mathew	0
: : So in conclusion it can be shown that there is essentially no : : logical argument which clearly differentiates a "cult" from a : : "religion". I challenge anyone to produce a distinction which : : is clear and can't be easily knocked down. : How about this one: a religion is a cult which has stood the test : of time. Just like history is written by the `winners' and not the `losers.' From what I've seen of religions, a religion is just a cult that was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it's doctrine using political and military measures. Perhaps if Koresh withstood the onslaught for another couple of months he would have started attracting more converts due to his `strength,' hence becoming a full religion and not just a cult.	0
Not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible, excitable and easily led from some concrete cause. In that case we would also have to discuss if that concrete cause, rather than atheism, was the factor that caused their subsequent behaviour.	0
(deletion) Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism. The point is that theism is *a* factor. That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the field of theism, the leaders believe what they say. That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is, there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism. Gullibility, by the way, is one of them. And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer. That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed. Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular. I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here. An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want it that way. Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms. what is it you are trying to say? Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or the way the world works. Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because B (already believed) says it is wronG/ a waste of time/ not possible. Depending on the further contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can have interesting effects.	0
Yes. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No, look again. While you never *said* it, the implication is pretty clear. I'm sorry, but I can only respond to your words, not your true meaning. Usenet is a slippery medium. [deleted wrt the burden of proof] Look, I'm not supporting *any* dogmatic position. I'd be a fool to say that in the large group of people that are atheists, no people exist who wish to proselytize in the same fashion as religion. How many hard atheists do you see posting here, anyway? Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough... I never meant to do so, although I understand where you might get that idea. I was merely using the 'bible' example as an allegory to illustrate my point. Evidence for what? Who? I think I may have lost this thread... [why theists are arrogant deleted] Guilty as charged. What I *meant* to say was, the theists who *are* arrogant are this way because they say ... Other than that, I thought my meaning was clear enough. Any position that claims itself as superior to another with no supporting evidence is arrogant. Thanks for your apology, btw. Explained above.	0

Unlike #a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are #many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy #does not hold. I have, however, given an example of a VALUE people agree on, and explained why. People will agree that their freedom is valuable. I have also stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective ethics - the IF assertion above. And that is what I'm talking about, there isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed. #One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football, #while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees #with a set of morals YOU have to give. I'm not doing morals (ethics) if we can't get past values. As I say, the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable. Maybe not, and I want to think about this some, especially the implications of its being true. #Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing #your theory of absolute morals against competing theories. Garbage. That's not proof either. #The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer #the objections. Evidence that you are a preacher. Name that fallacy.	0

I might just as well divide the world into subject,object, event. It even seems more sensible. Causation, for example, is an event, not a subject or an object. Furthermore, if subject/object were true dichotomy, i.e. Everything is either a subject or an object Then, is that statement a self-evident truth or not? If so, then it's all in the mind of the beholder, according to the relativist, and hardly compelling. Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into the "subjective" category by an idealist or solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate set of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced to (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why yes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of the beholder. #>>If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?

BTW - I don't intend this as a strawman, but as something logically entailed by relativism (really any ethical system where values are assumed to be unreal). It's different to say "Relativists say..." than "relativism implies...".	0
However, to underestimate the power of religion creating historical events is also a big misunderstanding. For instance, would the 30-year-old war have ever started if there were no fractions between the Protestants and the Vatican? Cheers, Kent	0
From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84, the following is an introduction to the article "Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon", by George D. Smith. The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz. Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million. It is one of the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as 200,000 new converst in 1982 alone. Because of the church's aggressive missionary program, covering more than one hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world countries. Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and evangelical in preachment. The church is run along strict authoritarian lines. Led by a president, who allegedly receives revelations directly form God, and a group of twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief and practice, the church is opposed to abortion, pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea. Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy and politically powerful in Utal and many other western states. Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family, the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed government officials. The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief. This book, written "by the commandment of God," claims that the ancient Hebrews settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors of the American Indians. Mormons believe that those who have been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the hereafter. Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and as heretics by religious fundamentalists. Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud. Because of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois, where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob. Brigham Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice in nineteenth-century America. While other religions go back many centuries -- Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism, 3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon roots is possible. Some Mormons are willing to examine this history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny is dangerous to the faith. In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles about the Mormon church. First, George D. Smith, a lifelong member of the church, provides a detailed critical examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of Mormon_ was divinely revealed. Second, we present a portion of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz The article itself is super.	0

I believe (but when I get a copy of the latest research in June or July) that this was the figure proposed in the Census Bureau report on the matter. The report was suppressed and the CB attempted to sack the author of the report, but failed due to procedural technicality. The author is now on permanent leave.	0

: But how do we know that you're representing the REAL Christians? : ;-) : Bill, you're an asshole. Get lost. Maddi, I see that you still can't grasp the obvious, is it because your are devious by nature, or can you only find fault with an argument by misrepresenting it? I plainly said that I was stating the Christian position as I understand it, I did not say whether I agree with it since my point was that the only flaws in that position are those atheists invent. I have never claimed to be an expert on anything and especially Christianity, but I have made it an object of pretty intense study over the years, so I feel qualified to discuss what its general propositions are. What offends you is that I have exposed the distortions and misrepresentations of Christianity you contrive and then rail against, (which seems more like the classical strawman dodge than what I said) This leaves you with nothing but to attack but me. As usual, you avoid the larger issues by picking away at the insignificant stuff, why not find one particular thing in my post that we can discuss, or can you even tell me what the issues are?	0
There's a difference between believing in the existence of an entity, and loving that entity.

MILLER, JR "A Canticle for Leibowitz" One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives copying blueprints from "Saint Leibowitz", filling the sheets of paper with ink and leaving white lines and letters. EDGAR PANGBORN "Davy" Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states. The church, for example, forbids that anyone "produce, describe or use any substance containing... atoms". PHILIP K. DICK Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels. His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology. Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical. Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance: "Galactic Pot-Healer" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans. When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply. A polished, ironic and amusing novel. "A Maze of Death" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion. "VALIS" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin. He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters. "The Divine Invasion" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system. Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music. MARGARET ATWOOD "The Handmaid's Tale" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it "right" again. The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy. Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible. Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the "old world" are hunted down and hanged. Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on. VARIOUS AUTHORS "The Bible" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized. However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about. It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one true version. Books -- Non-fiction PETER DE ROSA "Vicars of Christ", Bantam Press, 1988 Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very enlighting history of papal immoralities, adulteries, fallacies etc. (German translation: "Gottes erste Diener. Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums", Droemer-Knaur, 1989) MICHAEL MARTIN "Atheism: A Philosophical Justification", Temple University Press, Philadelphia, USA. A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism. Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious area. Argues both for "negative atheism" (i.e. the "non-belief in the existence of god(s)") and also for "positive atheism" ("the belief in the non-existence of god(s)"). Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne. 541 pages. ISBN 0-87722-642-3 (hardcover; paperback also available) "The Case Against Christianity", Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity, in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and (ultimately) demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent. 273 pages. ISBN 0-87722-767-5 JAMES TURNER "Without God, Without Creed", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD, USA Subtitled "The Origins of Unbelief in America". Examines the way in which unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic) became a mainstream alternative world-view. Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England developments. "Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism, Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea, the belief that God exists." 316 pages. ISBN (hardcover) 0-8018-2494-X (paper) 0-8018-3407-4 GEORGE SELDES (Editor) "The great thoughts", Ballantine Books, New York, USA A "dictionary of quotations" of a different kind, concentrating on statements and writings which, explicitly or implicitly, present the person's philosophy and world-view. Includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many people. For some popular observations, traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries. Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's "What Great Men Think of Religion" and Noyes' "Views of Religion". 490 pages. ISBN (paper) 0-345-29887-X. RICHARD SWINBURNE "The Existence of God (Revised Edition)", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with "The Coherence of Theism" (1977) and was concluded with "Faith and Reason" (1981). In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God. His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's "The Miracle of Theism". In the revised edition of "The Existence of God", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie. J. L. MACKIE "The Miracle of Theism", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God. It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne. It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as "replacements for God" such as Lelie's axiarchism. The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne. JAMES A. HAUGHT "Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History of Religious Murder and Madness", Prometheus Books Looks at religious persecution from ancient times to the present day -- and not only by Christians.

Consider special relativity. It hasn't be proved, nor has it been disproved. No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people are interested in it! I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of God one way or the other. The two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism. Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism. In naturalism, any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance). For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,'' and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist) would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did, and that loud voice is something new. Perhaps we didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.'' I'm sure glad you don't know where I live, since you don't seem to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices in your head, and God's voice. You seem to have missed my point. Even if Jim Jones and David Koresh were not religious people, my point remains that faith and dogma are dangerous, and religion encourages them. Jim Jones and David Koresh also encouraged them. My point does not rely on Jim Jones and David Koresh being religious.	0
Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze. This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion, a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence. I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically. I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over, I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works, thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion. I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read. I learned what it means to use _reason_. As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X, it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. But it can still be wrong. I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god playing any part. Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance, the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible. Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood. This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind, and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the evidence. It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not. I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented. A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible again. I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself. Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind. But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence, it looks like she doesn't. Petri	0
I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Now, how is it such a grave mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons? Or are you claiming that we shouldn't sell any weapons to other countries? Straightforward answer please. Who benefits from arms sales? Hint, it isn't normally the gov't. It is the contractor that builds that piece of equipment. Believe it or not, the US and UK don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have just accused them of doing. Arms exports are rare enough, that it requires an act of congress for non-small arms to most countries, if not all. Do you believe in telling everyone who can do what, and who can sell their goods to whom?	0

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus. In the real world (tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those people who are of the same opinion as they are. In college you are constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have different ideas about life, the universe, and everything. It is much much harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from reaching you. So, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in their beliefs over four years. There is nowhere to run.... :-)	0
I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue. Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination, grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity. At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness. He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years. After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness. Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.	0
(Deletion) (rest deleted) That's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out. For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy does not hold. One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football, while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals YOU have to give. Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.	0

existance. *************************************************************************** I just thought it necessary to help defend the point that Jesus existed. Guys: Jesus existed. If he didnt, then you have to say that Socrates didnt exist cuz he, like Jesus, has nothing from his hands that have survived. Only Plato and others record his existance. Many others record Jesus' existance, including the Babylonian Talmud. Sorry guys, the argument that Jesus may not have existed is a dead point now. He did. Whether he was God or whether there is a God is a completely different story, however. *****************************************************************************	0

[This is SWF in another indirect post via Dan]. predicitions if you have some many types of happen again may predict reaction There are several problems here. First, you are discussing only experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful. The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the observations be *new*. This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense. Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms. It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. The observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer may look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum). Also, there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one. New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly. Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils. Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have. (For instance, the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles, rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed). So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the necessary sense. Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the original event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations. [This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra- terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy]. -- sarima@teradata.com (formerly tdatirv!sarima) or Stanley.Friesen@ElSegundoCA.ncr.com	0

Much of the Haight-Ashbury crowd probably had pre-existing dissatisfactions with their lives -- dissatisfactions ameliorated by mumbo-jumbo about 'new realities'. The only change I experienced after LSD was to gain the knowledge that I didn't enjoy how LSD twisted my perception. -- Mark Pundurs	0
Sounds like more of the same. Gods were used to describe almost everything in the past. As we come to understand the underpinnings of more and more, the less we credit to a god. Now, the not-so-well understood elements (at least by the author) includes quarks and tectonic drift. I guess that's better than describing the perceived patterns of stars in the sky as heroes being immortalized by the gods. Kinda sounds like old-earth creation--It seems that life did, indeed, evolve from a common ancestor. What caused that initial common ancestor? Are we going to hear another debate on causeless events? ;-)	0
I and many others on a.a have described how we have tried to find god. Are you saying our efforts have not been sincere? For all the effort I have put in, there has been no outward nor inward change that I can perceive. What's a sincerely searching Agnostic or Atheist supposed to do when even the search turns up nothing? How do you "accept that which you don't know"? Do you mean that I must believe in your god in order to believe in your god?	0

My last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanished (though appearing locally). I'll repost it, since I always feel slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a conversational thread, I don't want Rob to think I'm doing so. Since this is now dated, however, don't feel compelled to respond... I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a "face value" interpretation... While the context of the time is important, value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.). This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people, for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits. We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like. For instance, in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue? By the Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible. Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see no support for. One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman. More to the point, such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common. Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance claiming that Hammurabi's "an eye for an eye" was primitive brutal retribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine (because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way). As of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing. I don't belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual ones, of the Jewish people. I have given up on trying to think by analogy, since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all similar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don't know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison). I think a tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation, is a good thing. I think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a 1943 Captain America comic (or whatever the Babylonian equivalent would have been). -- Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

From: jbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com There are many indications that would have taken place had Saddam been wanting or planning on going into Saudi Arabia. There were none. This has been openly stated by ex-Pentagon analysts. Pull.

From: jbrown@batman.bmd.trw.com We're also hypocrites of the first magnitude. Obviously, we don't give a shit about freedom and democracy. All we care about is our oil. Oh, and the excuse, now that the Soviets are gone from the board, to keep a sizable military presence in the gulf region. Care to make bets about when ALL our troops will come home? Basically, Saddam was OK with us. He was a killer, who tortured his own people, used gas on them, and other horrors - he was a brutal dictator, but he was OUR brutal dictator. Once he said "fuck you" to the US, he became the next Hitler. The same for Noriega. He was a bastard, but he was OUR bastard...until he changed his mind and went his own way.

This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead, really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism. So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical nature.	0
This is the most unmitigated bilge I've seen in a while. Jim Brown obviously has possession of the right-wing token. "In December, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski told a Senate committee that sanctions were costing Iraq $100 million per day, and that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world. Iraq, he suggested, was losing badly every day it defied the UN demands, while the community of nations won every day -- with no taking of life or loss of life." -- FCNL Washington Newsletter. Wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the US government, perhaps? Regrettable, of course; The-Way-It-Is - certainly not. Good heavens! An escapee from Rush Limbot Land! "Conservative", my ass. BULLSHIT!!! In the Gulf Massacre, 7% of all ordnance used was "smart." The rest - that's 93% - was just regular, dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. Have you forgotten that the Pentagon definition of a successful Patriot launch was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage? Or that a successful interception of a Scud was defined as "the Patriot and Scud passed each other in the same area of the sky"? And of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. Again - try to follow me here - that means 65% of this "smart" arsenal missed. Prove it. I have a source that says that to date, the civilian death count (er, excuse me, I mean "collateral damage") is about 200,000. -s -- "No one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in Washington state, but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than incarceration. "California is spending more than $90 million annually on capital cases, and until this year hadn't executed anyone since 1972.

RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992 WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic. But to do so is absolutely useless now. If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait. Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation. "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." - Matthew 24:13 II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ's second coming. Also know as "the time of Jacob's (Israel's) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel's Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror. III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community (the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason. The Bible, however, will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation. IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them. It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you. V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray. Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ. VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell, or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name. Money will be useless. "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666" - Revelation 13:16-18. The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity. Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past, such as the Holocaust. [or maybe the crusades? -M] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And a white robe was given to each of them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be killed as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11. His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4. He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ. Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark. If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however, you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire. [Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M] You cannot be redeemed. It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire. "...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation 14:9-10 [and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake. The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas. Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation. ["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak. Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school closings" --M] Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark. Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. [Get a good water filter. --M] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights, batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies. In short, learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did. VIII. TRUST NO ONE There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's government. Be on the lookout. [Perot supporters take note --M] IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to, for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it. We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man. Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves. He will be physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and personality. An international politician, military tactician and economic expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which he will break after three and a half years. He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed. Even the very elect will be deceived. If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived. [Dominate the airwaves? Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M] The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak. All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed. The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere. X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE! The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ. The Antichrist will be defeated. Be steadfast and endure, and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven. Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now. The salvation of your sould depends upon it. Determine that, come what may, you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist. You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death." May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return! ****************************************************************************** Mike Cluff * "Christianity is Stupid. v22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms * Give up." -Negativland UB Language Perception Laboratory * ****************************************************************************** /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM They said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away, and sank Manhattan out at sea.	0
Another article that fell between the cracks: As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce their claim that Jesus had come back from the dead. Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any... Briefly, no. There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles. Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "No Martyrs for a Lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief. This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting. Since we don't even know how or where they died, we certainly don't have this information. (By the way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting). The willingness of true believers to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little. [See 1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests of Baal].	0
Not by any standard of history I've seen. Care to back this up, sans the lies apologists are so fond of? Not really. Most of the prophesies aren't even prophesies. They're prayers and comments taken from the Torah quite out of context. Seems Xians started lying right from the beginning. My we're an arrogant ass, aren't we? You're wrong to think we haven't. The trust was in something that doesn't exist. I'm still willing to die for what I believe and don't believe. So were the loonies in Waco. So what? Besides, the point's not to die for what one believes in. The point's to make that other sorry son-of-a-bitch to die for what *he* believes in! :) Doesn't anyone else here get tired of these cretins' tirades? Peter the Damed, and damned proud of it!	0
"Liberate" is the way an invader describes an invasion, including, if I'm not mistaken, the Iraqi liberation of Kuwait. Never invaded Nicaragua? Only with more word games: can you say "send in the Marines?" Oh, good: word games. If you let the aggressor pick the words, there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action. That's a convenient technique, much seen on alt.atheism: define those who disagree with you according to a straw-man extreme that matches virtually nobody. Very noble and patriotic. I'm sure the fine young Americans who carpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon, destroyed Iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the sky or further, or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their trenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were just thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the defense of the liberty of ... well, wealthy Kuwaitis. Can't have those oil-fields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic to US interests... Having pigeon-holed "peace-niks" (in this context, "people who disagree with me about the conduct of the Gulf War") into "peace-at-all-cost-hitler-supporting-genocide-abetting-wimps", you can now express righteous indignation when "they" refuse to fit this mold and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms. HOW DARE THEY! Yes, hypocrisy indeed! Those violent peace-niks! (Care to list an example here?) Wow: instant '80's nostalgia! [Of course, "peace-nik" itself is a '50's Cold War derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism with Godless Pinko Communists]. Yes indeed, I felt my freedoms mightily threatened by Iraq...	0

[Interchange on Hoban deleted] Only those you haven't actually read? Sorry, but the irony remains. So although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think Rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due sympathy for being being under this threat. Furthermore you base this reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the absolute truth of your religion. Yet, this opinion is formed without recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context, accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this book contains and what the author's motivations are. And then you come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably "plays with") religious/historical material because you find its overall presentation neutral!	0
A world creator god does, the moment it creates the world. And to sayi that you can't recall *anyone* is even below your usual standard of a"arguing". My argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions, namely god is perfect, god is all-knowing god sets the rules. The rules don't work for whatever reason. Because of its omniscience, the god has known it. In advance. (Deletion) It is not a question of grammar, it is a question of modelling. Has been discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group. When A is contradictorily defined A does not point to an instance in reality. Unless there is more information in the definition of A that allows me to find it somehow. However, when the contradictory attribute is said to be essential, ie has not got that attribute => not the A I am looking for, I can conclude that A does not exist. That's quite like: I predict coins falling Predicted Happened 1. Heads Tails 2. Tails Tails 3. Heads Tails 4. Heads Tails I take 2. and dismiss the rest because of the unnecessary complexity the other evidence causes.	0
I can (and do) take religious writings as a metaphor for life. I do this with all sorts of fiction, from Beowolf to Deep Space Nine. The idea is to not limit yourself to one book, screen out the good stuff from what you read, and to remember that it is all just a story. You sound Buddist to me :^)	0
I saw a 3 hour show on PBS the other day about the history of the Jews. Appearently, the Cursades(a religious war agianst the muslilams in 'the holy land') sparked the widespread persecution of muslilams and jews in europe. Among the supporters of the persiecution, were none other than Martin Luther, and the Vatican. Later, Hitler would use Luthers writings to justify his own treatment of the jews.	0

I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seems popular here right now). And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me. (And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of a sentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.) At the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and I couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this was allegory. It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely. (And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!) Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some "holy" guy. Not to mention murder the author.) I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read "Mein Kampf?" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they just read the book and decide for themselves? Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of protest from the "liberal" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the final push I needed into atheism! -s	0
#|> # #|> #Noting that a particular society, in this case the mainland UK, #|> #has few religously motivated murders, and few murders of *any* #|> #kind, says very little about whether inter-religion murders elsewhere #|> #are religiously motivated. #|> #|> No, but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent #|> in all religion (or for that matter, in catholicism and protestantism) #|> that motivates one to kill. # #"Motivates" or "allows?" The Christian Bible says that one may kill #under certain circumstances. In fact, it instructs one to kill under #certain circumstances. I'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them to kill under certain circumstances. I do get your distinction between motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows' atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism. But it rather depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are. When you talk about Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood. It's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls apart.

That was religously motivated. # #What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic #labourers? That *wasn't* religiously motivated? Not in my opinion. If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology, then yes. But since all protestants don't do this (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad too say "religion did this". I'm saying that the causes are far more complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism. You know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the killing', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not to read minds. # # #|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions, #|> and the many religous wars. # #What's so special about these exceptions? Isn't this all just a #grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders #to be religiously motivated? What's the general principle behind #all this? The general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.

You've speculated on my motives often enough, and you don't take my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim not to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry. I also note that you fail to answer my question. It just looks to me very much like you have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what most Protestants say - which is @stop the killing". The people you refer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants. # #As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion- #based? It is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism. None of these things are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some overlap.	0
Well, yes. This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories. There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted. These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy. The DSS tend to reflect the same "errors". This would appear to tell us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically. The problem is, we don't know what they did before that. But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts. They may be added to (and in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text. You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Some people like to use the game of "telephone" as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts. This clearly wrong. The texts are transmitted accurately.	0
Your post is based on the premise that the laws as they stand do not discriminate anybody, so your argument falls over immediately.

I have indeed heard of Pythagoras, but I don't know that he was ever disparaged as a "bean eater". In the American Southwest and West (e.g., Texas, California, Colorado), the term "bean eater" is sometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage (generally Mexicans, in those parts) -- much like how the Irish in the Northeast are perceived (by some) as voracious beer guzzlers.	18
People *die* of natural causes, too. We hear all this bellyaching over things like murder and war while Mother Nature is killing people all of the time. In fact, more people die of natural causes than due to the conscious actions of other people. So, what's a few murders here and there? --	18
After the initial gun battle was over, they had 50 days to come out peacefully. They had their high priced lawyer, and judging by the posts here they had some public support. Can anyone come up with a rational explanation why the didn't come out (even after they negotiated coming out after the radio sermon) that doesn't include the Davidians wanting to commit suicide/murder/general mayhem?	18
No, what it means is that I, like a majority of environmental scientists/researchers, agree that El Nino/La Nina and the Southern Oscillations are the systems involoved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought(1988). Furthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent eruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.). Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx. 360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok project). Furthermore, the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5. This OVERWHELMING data/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University. The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this data from government and international scientific institutions is. It is a pity, that, if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh psycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with which to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age.	18
Well they could unseal the original warrent (Why was i sealed in the first place?), release their video & tapes (from their listening devices inside the compound) and quit makeing contradictory statements. Do you believe their statement that the children were killed by lethal injection? They later stated that the childrens bodies were burned to the point the would be hard to identify. So how did they come up with the lethal injection theory? Unless the evidence was destroyed or other evidence planted. You mean "Magic bullet" Spector? I know, a lone gunman killed all the Branch Davidians. :-) || :-(	18
Proving once again that Brett has a major thinking problem... Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the "medically an needy" (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical care). The typical elderly person spends 3.5 times what a person under age 65. The typical medically needy person spends about 10 times what the average person does. You've got to adjust those data, Brett.	18
The Waco/Whacko Bar-B-Q caused me to remember an official explanation from the Vietnam War. The 90s, liberal version is: "It was necessary to incinerate the children in order to save them."	18

THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12:36 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, the President is going to come out at 1:15 p.m. With your indulgence, I think what we'd like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions. So if we can just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably will work out a lot better. Q If you'll give us the time. That's the problem. Q We've got a two-minute warning problem. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, it is a problem. It's about 1:15 p.m. Q The teacher would walk off and then -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's -- I'm just trying to work this out here. I think that's the best way to handle it. Q Can I ask you a series of questions about the way the President handled the notifications yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. Q Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Why don't we just take a step even farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on the contact between the Justice Department and the White House. As you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon. They had a good discussion, about 15 minutes. The Attorney General informed the President of what she wanted to do. He raised no objections. Obviously, she had the implicit authority from the President to go forward. He raised no objections. She went forward. They had a discussion of a general nature about the incident. Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the President spoke with the Attorney General again. They had a brief discussion over what was happening in Waco. As you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound. And I think that was why there was some -- just some confusion. I think that she was confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day when they spoke. Then there was a number of contacts at a number of different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the Justice Department and the White House. They were informing us of their decisions, what they would like to do. There was an FBI briefing in Waco. The Attorney General had her press conference. The President then issued a statement after that. Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was actually happening on the ground. Once we were fairly clear on what was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a statement. He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday evening. Q At what hour was that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It was quite late. I believe it was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum. He took a tour of the Holocaust Museum last night. Q And he went out to dinner. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe briefly. Yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night. I don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late. And he just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well, that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try and get some sleep. He then, again, spoke with her this morning about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this afternoon. As you know, the President will have an announcement to make at 1:15. Q Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge, no. Q Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Webb Hubbell is the general White House Liaison and several people talked to Webb. The Attorney General was running the operation. Q Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job? Or he just tell her that she should get some sleep? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think sleep well -- done a good job -- I don't know the exact words. I think that sounds right. Q I mean, sleep well has implications as to conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I mean, I think everybody feels badly when you have a situation when -- Q I understand that, but whether the issue of blame is brought up in that phraseology. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that. The spirit with which it was offered was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation yesterday. And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best as she could and -- Q Well, does he think it was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend. Q Does he think the situation was mishandled? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President -- Q In retrospect? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President stands by the decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the Attorney General. He accepts full responsibility. At the same time, I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen again, or at least we know how to handle it. Q How much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with? I know that she made the case to him -- explained -- outlined the case for action. Did she say to him on Sunday precisely what action? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think it was specific operational detail as to what was going to happen. I think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action. I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just trying to get a sense of how things were considered. But it wasn't minute-by-minute detail of how the operation -- Q Well, was it, "we are going in." Is it, "we're going to use tear gas"? I mean, what? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe it was that we want to go in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement out. Q George, was there ever a conscious political decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President from -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, we were in close contact with the Justice Department. The President accepts responsibility for this. At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as we could be on how the decisions were made. It is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations. The Attorney General has operational control over this. The President obviously accepts responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney General. Q George, there was a report on the television today -- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire and not themselves. There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of a smashing into the building where the fire broke out. And my question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: All the evidence we have is that this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound -- every bit of evidence we have. Q Did the President ask the Attorney General why do this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible consequences of either death or injury? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know the specific questions. He had general questions about how the decision was going about being made. Q Those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he asked, have you considered all of the consequences; have you considered the recommendations? I don't know if he asked the question, "why now? " I don't know if he asked that specific question. Q Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff that's come out since then about the information provided by the listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I'm not certain how much specific detail they got into. I know that she generally said that this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the decision she's prepared to make. It's based on the recommendations she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of those involved. Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that. Q What is the President's understanding why yesterday? One of the people who went into the compound a couple weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this action. Why yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: This is the first I've heard. I think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has said. There were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger. It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that the situation was not going to get any better at all. There was also some concern over the vulnerability of the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that these teams normally have to work. And as the Attorney General has said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a concern over the safety. All of these factors came into play. They also considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts on David Koresh and those in the compound. I would just go back to what the Attorney General has said. You have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time. They did. Obviously, we all regret the loss of life. It's a terribly unfortunate situation. We all wish it could have turned out differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were made at the time. Q George, when did the President know that they were going to use tear gas? Was it before the assault on the compound? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just don't know. I don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go. I just don't know. Q Along that point, George, can you say whether the plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was presented as a way to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped, as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it. Q Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, I think he's satisfied that they were acting on the best advice and the best information they had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever. Q George, was there a 12-hour gap between conversations between the President and the Attorney General? In other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again until Clinton got back from dinner at -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that's likely, yes. Q Did he call her? What time did she call? Was there a gap between when she called him? I mean, was he at dinner when she called and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no, no. I think he called her last night. I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last night. He just wanted to talk to her. Q what was going on? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not that I know of, no. Q What do you know about the situation now? Everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine? And do you know any of the other details? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know any more details than the FBI reported in Waco. Q watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what is going on? If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was he keeping track of what was going on here? I mean, with all due respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. There was also -- as I said, several people in the White House were in constant contact with their counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information. Q Who were those contacts? I mean, was it Mack McLarty, Webb Hubbell? How was the President being kept informed? That's not a -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe Mack was in contact with Webb. I spoke with several people at the Justice Department. I believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department. Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during the day with people at the Justice Department. We were fully briefed and fully informed. Q We were told this morning that the President may have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb. Do you know if that's true or not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think there's a chance he may have. I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point. I don't believe he did. I think that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with the Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the Attorney General. But the White House was fully informed on a minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was happening at the Justice Department. Q George, who decided that the briefing would be done by the Attorney General? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General. Q Did you or did the White House communications staff -- were you ever involved with that decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. We were told about it. Q Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil- Lehrer and all that stuff? Was that part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q there was no advice from the White House at all about her -- she was on all night, all day. (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, and she did a very good job. Q Why did you decide to have the President's reaction to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not having him appear as personally saying anything? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that wasn't the intent at all. As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand. The President is also making a statement today. The President made a statement yesterday morning. The President has been fully involved -- Q After this turned into less than a successful operation, the only statement from the President was what was on paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to the major facts in this. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it was the first statement from the President, not the only statement from the President, number one. Q After the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Number two -- well, the first. Number two, the Attorney General -- Q He gave a statement early in the morning when the thing was starting to move -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. And he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today. Now, the second point -- Q It just happens this was a written statement with no sort of communications policy or thought process involved? It was the President wants to put out a written statement? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Knowing what we knew at the time, we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and expressing his support for the Attorney General's -- Q Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do something? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he did personally do so. That is his statement. It's a statement under his name. Q George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't say the President took full responsibility for what happened -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I certainly did. Q No, what you said was -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That's just not right, Susan. Q Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I mean, unless I miss something -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'd love to. Q Janet Reno said that she took full responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: And the President takes responsibility. Absolutely. Q Took responsibility -- all right. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Check the transcript. Q Considering how little was known about what was going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why is Washington calling this a mass suicide? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that knowing what we know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his control. Q It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that that is an entirely different matter. I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely. But he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did. Q You're still operating completely on assumption, right? I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We have evidence that those inside the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of those inside. Q I didn't quite hear it. This might be Ann's question, I didn't quite hear it. But at what time did Clinton himself put out a statement on this? I know Dee Dee said some stuff on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m. Q Right after the evening news went on the air? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, right when we had all the information. We were working on it. Q Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an administration-run investigation. Why not have someone from the outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have already been -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that clearly the ATF and the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the investigation. That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well. But it will be run by the Treasury and Justice. Q Are you confident that you will not have any problem getting -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Q George, did the President reach out to anybody else to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno? And who else in the White House sat in on that meeting? Anyone else from Justice? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe anybody else was there at the time. It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a meeting. Q Sunday. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sunday. It was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting. I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General. Q George, you said that in that phone call, she said that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force him out. What did he think she was talking about? If he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he was approving an action to increase the pressure on -- qQ It didn't matter how she did that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, no. I mean -- Q What information did he have in terms of how this would proceed? Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute- by-minute, but in a general sense -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he knew that this was the recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the law enforcement agencies. I just don't know -- Q What is "this" -- when you say that "this" was the recommendation -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The action to increase pressure. I don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure. I just don't know. Q It's hard to imagine him not asking, though. Q that Janet Reno presented him with as her best advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He was -- he did ask some general questions about the advice and recommendation he gave. At the same time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved. Q George, it would seem that this question about just exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere. Can you take that question and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Yes. Q get the answer and come back to us with all of it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be on all of these television broadcasts? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Never. Never. Q And you never called the Justice Department and said to anyone or Janet Reno, "you're the one who needs to be out front explaining this"? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not once. Q It just happened that way that she was the spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: She made a decision as Attorney General that it was important for her as the operational officer in charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the questions on this tragic incident. Q She had no guidance from the White House at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly didn't object. Q But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it? Was this a plan -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Absolutely not. Q a strategy? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she clear it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. Q Did she notify you? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We certainly knew about it. Q What happened to this great detailed process you have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and every -- under every rock and every place in government that something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion between you and the public information people at least at the Justice Department? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The Attorney General made the decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward. It seemed like a good decision. It was a good decision. She did a good job. Q Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how you would handle it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was handled very well. Q You wouldn't change a thing if -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Change what? Q The way the White House handled any part of it -- from start to finish. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I think that's an awful broad question and we're certainly going to have a review. One of the reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like this and see what we can learn about how to handle them. If you're talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no, there -- wouldn't make any change at all. Q Two questions: First of all, on her going on TV, no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this idea? It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: How so? Q I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline after the draft story; watching Clinton on -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: There's absolutely no comparison. Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident. The incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people. The Attorney General was involved in that decision. The Attorney General made the decision to do that. She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of public information to go out and take the questions of the press in order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she did a fantastic job. Q The second question is, did -- as someone who knows Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about what she intended to do? In other words, she came and she said, I'm going to put pressure on them. It's hard not to see Clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how. Q What kind? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Both the Attorney General said that he did ask questions, he did ask general questions. I don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation. Q How long a conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think it was about 15 minutes. Q Telephone conversation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't believe so, no. Q George, you keep saying that the President takes full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision. Does the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is ultimately his decision? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know what this has to do with Commander-In-Chief. This was a law enforcement action, not a military action. And he clearly takes responsibility for the decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his government. I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that. Q But is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision? There's a difference. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As a matter of fact, it was her decision. He did not object to that decision. He clearly takes full responsibility. Q George, this briefing has gone on just a little over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged. What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general? That's a long period of time in a phone conversation. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: It is an awful long phone conversation. It was a very important phone conversation. I think Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would. Q One of the things Reno said last night is that the buck stops here. I think that was her direct quotation. Does the President agree with that in this case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President says he accepts full responsibility. I think what the Attorney General was saying is that she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the responsibility that comes to her. And she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the President. Q At any point in the conversation last night between the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever offer her a resignation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to my knowledge. Q Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation. Is the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests trying to make political hay out of this situation? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And I don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation. We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation. Q In what forum will you answer Brit's question? Will you put out a written statement? Will you -- the wires? How will you answer the question that you've taken? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'm just not sure. Q George, can you remind us what the President was doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was involved in? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I'll have to try and remember. He had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon. He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and getting periodic reports on that as well. He did see some on CNN as well. I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as well. Q And those reports would have come to him from Mack McLarty, would they -- do you think? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to him, I talked to him. Q George, to follow Helen's question, in their conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last night in response to the question about whether she would resign? Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that? I'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this? Did that come up at all? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if it even came up that specifically. I know that the bulk of the conversation was discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation -- Q The didn't talk at all about her kind of remarkable comment last night about -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I believe she was asked a question. Q And her response was, if the President wants me to, I will. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Which would be, I think, the standard response that most Cabinet members would give. I mean, it's a conditional statement. Q have a need to talk about whether -- personally about whether the President wanted her -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know if they talked about it. I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was largely about the investigation itself. And this just didn't come up. I did not ask the question if they talked about -- Q Will you take that with the Brit package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Certainly. (Laughter.) Q George, for the record, does the President want her to resign? I know Dee Dee answered this morning -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely not. He supports Janet Reno. She's a good Attorney General. She's done a good job. She handled a difficult situation extremely well. Q George, does the President feel that he and Janet Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law enforcement experts on the ground? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No. And the President is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way. That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life. Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation. But the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had. Q George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on Sunday, is that correct? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't know. I'll take that question, too. Q Were these outside experts that they were consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: You'd have to ask them. I'm just not sure. I know that there were several experts. Q And also, why weren't there replacements for these people? Is the unit that small? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I think it is a very small highly-specialized unit. But I think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine. Q George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI Director? Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the Attorney General. I know the chain of command. But presidents talk to their FBI directors. In this case, throughout this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from him on what to do and what not to do? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think he talked to the FBI Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke out in Waco. At the same time, the Attorney General bears the ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the Attorney General. Q Don't you think the ambiguous situation that Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is briefed and on the way that all of this evolved? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I mean, it's perfectly appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and that's following the chain of command. THE PRESS: Thank you . END 1:03 P.M. EDT	18
Why are you all playing these pathetic number games? The number of people showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace. I doubt that it constitutes more than a handful of us. I'm queer, and I won't be there, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation. What the hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum number? Face it, people, we're everywhere. There are always more of us than you think. Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your children will grow up to join us. Hell, some of MY children may grow up to join us. The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear. We're not perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just like you--er, most of you. Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like. It won't do them one iota of good. Drewcifer P.S. I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are meaningful. And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER countries? Tree.	18
From article <1qvampINNmhf@darkstar.UCSC.EDU>, by stephen@orchid.UCSC.EDU: I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand. The media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data. One good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are posting. There is little evidence to show that they are in error. The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex events, however. I'm sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted. Cases that come to mind are the invasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco, the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military, the war on drugs, and many others. The story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey. While I'm sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey. I do, however, think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's analysis of this data. In this particular case, there was little analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her own convictions. Many netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the American media are merely a number of businesses, who's purpose in life is to make money for their owners and stockholders. Revenues come largely from advertisers who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar. The media is like fast food; the quality of the food (or of the reporting) will improve only if the customers demand as such. Otherwise, it is business as usual.	18
That study which was in the NEJM, I think, noted that the frequency of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in California (I guess richer people have more heart disease in California -) ) whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over seventy in Canada was relatively uniform across income distribution. Heart surgery was more frequent in California, but mortality and outcomes were essentially the same. The only potential problem I see with the private MRI facilty in Calgary is the self-referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial interest in it, which is basically unethical...but in Canada because of our small population, there is likely only to be a few private facilities involving only a small number of doctors, and thus I don't think the self-referral problem, which is an epidemic in the US, could ever get out of hand here. It is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully. What likely happened is the sponsors of the private MRI which include doctors anticipated that Alberta would need more MRI's, and instead of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another one or two, saw a business opportunity...where they would have a secure business from the public insurance side of things, and they could supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash.	18
Saw it in t.p.m., thanks. Yes, and the individual is not omitted; I just didn't fully articulate the principles of Fractal Federalism. All government powers derive from the People; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes that power into the Constitution of the level above (in the case of the lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures. We can of course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our Constitutional Convention :-). Once a power has been granted, it may be exercised by the legislature. Powers not in the original Constitutions must percolate upward, starting from the individual. The ratification process for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority. Granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government structure). This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read- "liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on). It is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- "big-government conservatives"). I personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and economic) that is going on now. This is IMHO a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in. One which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its people, while working within the realities of human nature. You do bring up the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means necessarily a "successful" idea. I believe that Fractal Federalism would at least bring many ideas to light, and The People would have the opportunity to democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas. If the Docialists, er, I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous People, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis. If Libertopia is possible, it will arise. If a balanced Conservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity, it will become clear to The People that it is best. Right, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower the government") except through the amendment process. That is how the Federal Government is supposed to work now, but the Supreme Soviet, er, I mean the Supreme Court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense. In my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever level we are talking about) could indeed ban churches. The constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion. The uppermost Constitution is still the Supreme Law of the Land. It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas. One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and they also need to have some control over their environment. In my "Fractal Federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the constitutions. Other "rights" are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them. When a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed upon. This cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom, but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes are a good idea. I am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to control the environment that their children live in. People feel that they have a "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances. There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods. I do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual instances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), I view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in. I see the alternative as near anarchy. Like I said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity. There are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group. I think that the "Fractal Federalism" approach is a sound, if not ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power. The libertarian scenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have right now is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the Supreme Court." I think I answered this above already, but let me expand a little more with an example. If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small 'l') scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me. "Autonomous" is a value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with a clear definition. Exactly who would you empower to make that value judgement? Lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions. Although I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit, I am at least trying to be long on solutions also. I am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas (I call them "my ideas", but they all come from an "average guy" reading of the U.S. Constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia). Sorry, the confusion was my fault. When I said that "Fractal Federalism" resembles the U.S. constitution, I meant it and thought it was pretty clear. I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the CONSENSUS of the people (although not the CONSENT of every individual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement). It is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the situation we have now. That is why I think the Supreme Court should be a jury court, with a different jury for each case. It is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still find it a repugnant idea? If so, what is your solution? I think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government I advocate, and it was my fault for not being more clear. The majority does not make the rules. The majority (or possibly a plurality) simply elects representatives to exercise limited government powers; those limited government powers derive from a large consensus, not a simple majority. And the Federal Government, in my scenario, still has the power to protect freedoms.

# ## Can someone tell me why when Mr. Cramer spouts on about homosexuals, # ## he only addresses homosexual men, and never, in any post I've read, # ## addressed lesbians? # # # #I can't really speak for Mr. Cramer here, but I can say that a # #homosexual [male] is an entirely different animal than a lesbian. # #There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the # #aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants. # # So it has nothing to do with your morals, its just that you wouldn't # have anything to wack off to if you didn't have tapes of Lesbians # going at it.... # # I think we are getting closer to the truth now. No, we are getting at Mr. Foard's sickness. This may surprise homosexuals, but lots of people in this country do NOT spend their time watching pornography and masturbating. Some of us have real lives, instead of sexual compulsions. But I don't expect a homosexual to understand that.	18
Yup, that was quite contemptuous of the President to make a decision that 12% disagree with...	18
Good grief! I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may be discussed intelligently! I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic minority. However, your argument again falls flat on its face. You state that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate with others [homosexuals, I assume] against your will. How do you know that you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted? Would you like to change your argument to read "forced to associate with truthfully homosexual people against my will"? You have no proof that anyone you now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your argument. Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic) and that is the camp mincing type? Prove it. You cannot. I must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response this time instead of just raving.	18
Sorry, but I'd have to differ. The Canadian-bashing wrt to the health insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting. Having kept up with this debate on the net for some months, just about all the criticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even the anti-Canadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry and the AMA. In a few cases, such as Mr. Case, the critiques are well-reasoned and worthy of response. Most others are misinformed, illogical, or just plain dumb. I don't think the same can be said of the "American proponents" of the Canadian system, much less of the Canadian proponents. jsh	18
The White House Office of the Press Secretary ----------------------------------------------------------------- For Immediate Release April 19, 1993 STATEMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in Waco today. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's victims. The law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today. The Attorney General informed me of their analysis and judgment and recommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely. I told the Attorney General to do what she thought was right, and I stand by that decision.	18
The first thing I would do would be to disband Medicare and Medicade! They are a primary reason why health care costs are going up. To cover the people that are currently on these programs, I would sell their coverage in blocks to insurance companies. The private companies would bid to get these large blocks of people, and prices would go down. To get away from strong federal control on health care, I would pass off more control to the states. Everyone is always spewing forth about how wonderful Hawaii is doing. Well, how about giving some other STATES incentive to try their own plans What I would NOT do is try to implement some far reaching federal program program to cover all Americans, because this is the surest way to fail! One sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the federal government. Our FEDERAL taxes should be slashed, and our STATE taxes increased. A strong central government always fails. Give power back to the states/counties/cities, where it belongs.	18
Sure ... because it's a non-market phenomenom and the free market can't solve it. Even our private insurance says that .... .... and wants no part of it. Canada is saturated by American media. While pundits come on cable and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be, what people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see portrayed on American television in movies (i.e., same infrastructure, different insurance make-up). Yet they know not of any insurance problems, and have no idea of what an HMO is ... but having lots of British TV as well, they know that they don't like NHS. The polls that you refer to, for the Canadian data, are from the annual July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers, and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations. The American polls are Harris polls, and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again. I'm sorta suspicious myself, 'cos maybe Americans want universal coverage like Canada --- I honestly doubt that most Americans realize that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals (i.e., similiar health care infrastructure) and our "system" is basically pure insurance without HMO's. Until the idea of managed competition arose, there was no direct threat to stand-alone private practice. In the 1960's, the AMA fought HMO's as corporatized socialist medicine ... part of the reason why we have only insurance, and no HMO's in Canada 'cos that was part of the deal cut with the CMA. But each site is probably compact, and the clientele are creamed. And don't forget that HMO's place caps on your coverage, and often won't tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise (despite that you might be willing to pay for it). gld	18
]Furthermore, in response to an earlier message, the 1992 U.S. est. output of ]sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent ]eruption of Mt. Pinautubo(Sp.). Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx. ]360 ppm, in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info ]was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S. Vostok ]project). Furthermore, the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into ]the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually, it now sits at 3.5. This OVERWHELMING ]data/info is found in the World Resources doc. published by Oxford University. Good evidence. ]The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger ]and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this ]data from government and international scientific institutions is. It is a pity, that, ]if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their Limbaugh ]psycho babble, then we will find ourselves strapped by limited options with ]which to rectify the primal engineering of our industrial age. What ozone hole in the northern hemisphere? What exactly will happen if we get an ozone hole in the upper atmosphere? According to the senior chicken-little at NASA, as much more UV radiation as if one moved 100 miles south. Certainly not the calamity that is being imagined by eco-lunatics. CO2 is going up. So what. There's no evidence that the increase is due to burning fossil fuels, no evidence that increasing CO2 will increase temperatures, and no evidience that raising temperatures will do anything but good--ie make millions of acres of tundra into productive life-bearing land.	18
Now which is it? Are you going to comdemn national media, then turn around and use it to support some position you present? Seems somewhat contradictory doesn't it. I believe this true when we speak of physical data, in the sense of pure science. But when we speak of data that revolve around social sciences then we have to be careful. I quite agree. But these are cases or 'news events' that contain politics, social science information, sociology, etc. and at best are reflections of the group that reports them. As you have pointed out, it is difficult to report that the temperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have people believe you. Yes and no. The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer, a value called the median- which one used this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners. Homosexuals are purported to make up only 1%. In this case, the majority of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual. It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage. But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity. Very good- this is a point that I have tried to bring out, and as any network news program will show you, it is true. The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties lie.	18
#Really? I thought that insurance companies hired all of #their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated #with all groups of people, and that gays are more likely #to have AIDS than are those of other sexual orientations. Correlation != causality. The risk factor is having non-monogomous unprotected sex, not being homosexual.	18

Here in Georgia, the state legislature in 1992 "accidentally passed a law lobbied for by Opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed MD from giving shots. They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with them. They inadvertantly forbade nurses, EMTs, dentists, and tattoo artists from "piercing the skin." (probably diabetics too). The Secretary of State's office announced on June 30th that they wouldn't enforce it pending reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature. In the hassle over the state flag I heard nothing about repealing it.	18
: [...] When you and the rest of the homosexual community : pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to : hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against : my will, yes, you are in my face. Until homosexuals stop trying : to impose their morals on me, I will be in your face about this. Ahh, what's good for the goose is not necessarily what's good for the gander. You don't want homosexuals to impose their moral codes (such diabolical ideas as equal rights) on you, yet you are willing to impose your moral codes on them. Do I detect a double standard?	18
Larry King Live was both telling and sickening. Every other word out of Janet REno's mouth was "the little children" ,etc. Sounded like Clinton talking. She made claims that the children were beaten, etc, DESPITE the pronouncements of social workers that none of the children who left the compound were abused. But the REAL crime: Larry King, and his censored show. NOT ONE FUCKING QUESTION about Reno's possible error. Just two calls about how she had made a "good decision". Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that SOME people are going to be upset.	18
Out and out lie. Not substantiated. I do not understand statments like these. Please stop making such ridiculous claims. Maybe you should consider working for or getting your information from the National Inquirer for now on. Ahh! Rabbit from a hat. Here is another desperate step to discount any activity of the Washington Gay March.	18
This might be illegal without a very specific Presidential declaration or even a change in law. In general (sic), U.S. military troops are not permitted to be used for domestic policing operations.	18
Janet Reno, the FBI, et al were nothing but pawns in Koresh's game. He was a madman who was going to hurt the children, and everyone else in the compound no matter what the FBI did. Such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions with the result of the police trying to take the place by force and the result being the death of the hostages and the gunmen. However, this is the first time I've heard of the blame landing squarely on the police. In this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down from terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages other terrorists and hostage takers.	18
THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ___________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 23, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 10:35 A.M. EDT MS. MYERS: At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press conference, Bill, in the East Room. And then Saturday the President will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown. He will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to Boston. He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press plane will leave from Washington. He will meet with some -- Q What kind of a plane is that he's taking? MS. MYERS: That he's taking? He'll probably take a C- 20. Q From Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: From Hagerstown. Air Force One doesn't fly out of Hagerstown, apparently. Q How will the pool travel? MS. MYERS: The pool will have to meet him ahead of time. So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport. There is currently no provision -- and I'll double-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think that's standard operating practice. Q The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at Hagerstown? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Q What time does he have to be in Boston? MS. MYERS: He's going to meet there with a group of citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at around 1:30 p.m. We're still working out the final times. Q At the airport? MS. MYERS: No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel. And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21. The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m. It will be followed by Q&A. And then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston. And that's it for the weekend. Q Has the President seen the report from -- or the letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright? And what is his reaction to their call on him? MS. MYERS: Well, obviously, the letter was written to Secretary Christopher. I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday. He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views. He believes it's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy. Q What is the President's reaction? MS. MYERS: The President hasn't seen the letter. It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher. In terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't there before. And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia. Q Is he influenced by that? I mean, how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers -- MS. MYERS: Many of the specialists in that area -- I think that that is clearly part of the process. It's something -- their views will clearly be considered. I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views. I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who work closely on the issues. Q What do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before? MS. MYERS: I think the President said last week that there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being considered. Q Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along. Is that on the table? MS. MYERS: Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the President. But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies. He's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus there. Q Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today? MS. MYERS: No. I mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today. Q Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action? MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies at this point. He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with its allies on this. Q On that point, does he believe that the U.S., though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action? MS. MYERS: Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort. I think the broader point is that anything we do, any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it. Q Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia? MS. MYERS: I think that that's why we're considering additional options. I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling. The situation in Bosnia is tragic. The President is very concerned about it. He has -- I think President Clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world community. Clearly, we're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's not enough. Q In terms of what you were just talking about, it sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to protect humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word justify. It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief. But I think that's just an explanation of the resolution. I think any action that we take will be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action. Q The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past. You're declining to do that this morning. MS. MYERS: No, I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly. MS. MYERS: I don't mean to imply a change in policy. The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this. Q One other little question. Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so. Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it. The President has not seen it. Q They met on Monday, right? Christopher met -- surely, he must have brought that up -- MS. MYERS: Again, they may have talked privately about it, but -- Q Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected, is that correct? MS. MYERS: No, I didn't say that at all. I said I won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications. Q She's advocating unilateral action and you're saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action. MS. MYERS: I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended. Q Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to that? MS. MYERS: I think that their views are obviously being considered. The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter. Q Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do? MS. MYERS: I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now. And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Department. Now, no decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a through review underway, and that their opinions are being very seriously considered. Q If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter? Did he say, good, this bolsters my position? Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't need right now? MS. MYERS: I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate. It's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal. Q So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line? MS. MYERS: I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome. Q Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q The unilateral option is on the table? MS. MYERS: I think all options are on the table. Q We've had two different -- Q Isn't that a change, Dee Dee? Q That would be a change of policy. Q Particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out. MS. MYERS: I think the President has been -- well, no. I don't -- that is not -- Q Are you talking about all options? MS. MYERS: All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that. So let me just review again what he has said. He has said that -- the President has said all options are on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground troops, which he has never suggested. He has ruled that out from the beginning. Q Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort? MS. MYERS: He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself. I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now. I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked about in broad terms. This is a very complicated situation. The options being presented and considered are very complicated. Q Air strikes on the table? MS. MYERS: Again, I think that's been fairly clearly pointed out that that's something that's being discussed. Q Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- MS. MYERS: No, ground troops are not being considered. Q You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy. Then you said everything is on the table. We're confused. Are unilateral actions on the table? MS. MYERS: All I can tell you is what the President has said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this. Q Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they don't go along -- MS. MYERS: He's continuing to consult with our allies on this. He's continuing to have discussions. He's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that's clear. The conversation is ongoing. We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this. Q Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians -- MS. MYERS: I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to. Q The British and the French. Q Yes, the British and French. They've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military. Does the U.S. believe differently from that? MS. MYERS: The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major, as you know. I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well. And I don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action. And I think that process is ongoing. Q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday. Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action? The allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything. MS. MYERS: The consultations are ongoing. That's all I can tell you at this point. Q Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference? MS. MYERS: No, that is not the intention of the press conference. Q What is the intention? MS. MYERS: It's an opportunity to take questions. He may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia. That will not happen. Q Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: It's sort of a general statement of where we are. Q After the first hundred days, you mean? MS. MYERS: It's not a long statement. I mean, this is just generally. Don't look for any major policy pronouncements. Q Do you know what the opening statement is? MS. MYERS: But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review. But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be. It's just to take questions. Q It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on. MS. MYERS: Since the major purpose here is just to take questions, it's not completely resolved yet. Q Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, would be an AIDS czar. Will he announce that today? And what's the delay on that? MS. MYERS: I don't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon. I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week. It is coming soon. I don't anticipate that happening today. Q What's the delay? Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar? MS. MYERS: I don't know that it's a delay. I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement. Q Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? And why wasn't her appointment announced here? MS. MYERS: The qualifications -- I don't know if there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see. I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds. Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service. I think there's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there. We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, which is Admiral William Crowe. Q Why would he appoint her, though, if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job? MS. MYERS: I don't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her. And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate. She never went up there for a hearing. But the President believes she's a very competent person. He's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is? Zoe Baird is on the President's Foreign Intelligence -- Q You said she never went up there for a hearing? Q Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws? MS. MYERS: Right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate. I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate. Q So you don't think that is any problem? MS. MYERS: I don't think there's any problem. Q She has been appointed to this board, is that a fact? MS. MYERS: Yes. Q Does she need confirmation for this? Does she need confirmation to be a member of the -- MS. MYERS: No. It's a presidential appointment. Q Usually, announcements are made here at the White House. Was there a decision not to announce her publicly? MS. MYERS: We didn't make an announcement. People who asked were told who the members of the board were. We didn't make an official announcement. If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names. Q I'd like to know. Q Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension? MS. MYERS: Not always. But, again, I'm happy to put this out. Q Isn't that the standard practice? Q That was past practice. MS. MYERS: Again, I'm happy to put it out. We'll put out a list of the members of the board today. Q Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely? MS. MYERS: I think generally but not always. And we're happy to put that out today. Q What is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board? MS. MYERS: There is roughly a dozen members on the board. It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the President. Again, the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe. Q And did he recommend Baird? Q What's the name of the board? MS. MYERS: It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, PFIAB. Q What's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien? Is that -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke? Q Let me phrase it another way. Why shouldn't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago? MS. MYERS: Because it's not. Q What's her experience in foreign intelligence? MS. MYERS: She's an experienced attorney, someone who the President believes is very competent and qualified. And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input. Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that is not the board's mission. It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters. He believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously talented and has said that throughout. Q Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board? MS. MYERS: I don't think so. On December 24th, when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board. So I don't believe there's ever been any -- Q Earlier than that, during the transition. MS. MYERS: No, I don't believe so. It was announced, again, on December 24th. Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced. Q Are members paid? MS. MYERS: I don't believe so, but I'll double-check. Q On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state? I guess it's the Texas Ranger reports. MS. MYERS: Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site. Clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it. Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet holes. I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice Department is looking into it. Q Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this? MS. MYERS: I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute. I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it. But as you know, there are several levels of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work together. Q Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything? MS. MYERS: I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that. Q What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech? MS. MYERS: It's going to be fairly general. I don't think it's going to be any specific announcements. I think it's going to be sort of a -- Q Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about? MS. MYERS: We're still working on it. But I wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that. Q Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"? (Laughter.) MS. MYERS: Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little bit broader look about what's happened in the last -- Q Foreign, domestic? MS. MYERS: A little bit of both, but I think a lot of domestic. Q And overview. MS. MYERS: Yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement. Q Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday? MS. MYERS: It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. Q Is that available? MS. MYERS: Not yet, but it will be. Sure. Q Are you going to put it out here or -- MS. MYERS: We'll probably put it out here on Sunday. Q Travel next week? MS. MYERS: Unclear. Q What was the question? Q Likely? MS. MYERS: I don't -- Q Likely? Possible? MS. MYERS: Possible. Q What's possible? MS. MYERS: Travel. Q George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week. Do you have days yet for them? MS. MYERS: Not yet. Q Can you tell us which order? MS. MYERS: Campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week. Q Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg? MS. MYERS: No. Q And any report in the aftermath of the day? MS. MYERS: Any readout from the day? Q Readout. MS. MYERS: It's possible. Jeff Eller will be down there. I think he can go through what the President did during the day. We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning. Q Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David. In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice? MS. MYERS: Twice. Q Why this weekend? MS. MYERS: He went two weekends ago, as you know, on the way home from his father-in-law's funeral. I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family. And this is just an opportunity to do the same. Q There's no march there. Q It has nothing to do with the march here? MS. MYERS: No. Q Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) -- MS. MYERS: He'll fly straight to Boston. Q Flying straight did you say? (Laughter.) Q George took a question yesterday on Waco. The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the FBI. And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas. Do you have an answer on that? MS. MYERS: I don't. I'll check. THE PRESS: Thank you.	18
## Don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners.... # #Not surprising. Remember, that study includes homosexuals as well. Err, earth to Clayton, you posted this to show that 2% were homosexual. So if we assume EVERY homosexual was promiscious, that leads us to conclude that 23 percent of heterosexuals are promiscious. And that first assumtion is a bad one. Clayton, it *IS* suprising from the claims you are making.	18
THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRESS The Rose Garden 1:36 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: On February the 28th, four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk. Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued. The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life. The Bureau's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably insane. He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency. He was, moreover, responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February. Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound. This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully. The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender. I was informed of the plan to end the siege. I discussed it with Attorney General Reno. I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask. I then told her to do what she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision. Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy. Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive. He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued. Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future. I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been done differently. I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review. Finally, I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people. I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances. Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco. I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks. And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now. Q Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, after 51 days, you decided -- Q Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT: I can't hear you both. If one will go first and then the other. Q Sorry. Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: I'll answer both your questions, but I can't do it at once. Q Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it? THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building. And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside. I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire. In fact, as you know, an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials. There were no shots coming back from the government side. I asked a number of questions. The first question I asked is, why now? We have waited seven weeks; why now? The reasons I was given were the following: Number one, that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. They might be needed in other parts of the country. Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out. Number three, that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with the passage of time. And number four, that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time. The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good. She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time. The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. Military people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it. And so I asked if the military had been consulted. The Attorney General said that they had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance. Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she should proceed and that I would support it. And I stand by that today. Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT: Wait. Go ahead. Q Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster? THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm bewildered by it. The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody. It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold. There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place. I talked to her yesterday. I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show, and I talked to her again this morning. A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control. I will say this, however. I was, frankly, surprised would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves. (Applause.) I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. They were heavily armed. They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on. We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life. They made the decision to immolate themselves. And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children. But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. And she said, it's because of the children. They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time. I have to take their word for that. So that is where I think things stand. Q Can we assume then that you don't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of patience? And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way? THE PRESIDENT: No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today. This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time. This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time. We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way. Is there something else we should have known? Is there some other question they should have asked? Is there some other question I should have asked? Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different? I don't know that. That's why I want the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have. There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world. And we may have to confront it again. And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, particularly when there are children involved. But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves. Q Mr. President, were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday? THE PRESIDENT: Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way. There were lots of other options pursued. If you go back -- you all covered it very well. The FBI -- you did a very good job of it. I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them early on seemed to be working. Some of the children got out, some of the other people left. There was a -- at one point, there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities. And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward. Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves. That's what they thought. Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks? Q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that? THE PRESIDENT: That's up to the Congress. They can do whatever they want. But I think it's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts. And as I said in my statement, if any congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully cooperate. There is nothing to hide here. This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country. Go ahead, Sarah. Q There are two questions I want to ask you. The first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks. And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion? THE PRESIDENT: They were not just practicing their religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws, any number of them. Q What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT: Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. And one of the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect. They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent. And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected. In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work. So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance. MS. MYERS: Last question. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying that -- Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments? THE PRESIDENT: What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen. And she said -- and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway. And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future. That was the judgment they made. Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know. What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning? I was sick. I felt terrible. And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up. That's the first thing I wanted to know. Thank you. Q Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision? Isn't it, in the end, your decision? THE PRESIDENT: Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI. I didn't go over every strategic part of it. It is a decision for which I take responsibility. I'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call. When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed. She might have made a decision to change her mind. I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. And I do support her. She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am. But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have. Thank you. (Applause.)	18
On 20 Apr 93 13:34:03 GMT, Gary Piatt observed: : First, the median does not imply that half of the men are : above and half below 7.3: it simply means that 7.3 is the mid-point : between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most : likely zero). Actually, the median *is* defined as the 50th percentile. If the median number of sexual partners for men is 7.3, it means that at least 50% of men have had 7.3 or fewer sexual partners, and at least 50% of men have had 7.3 or more sexual partners. (Question: What is 0.3 of a sexual partner? :) To confuse matters more, take the following data set: [5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 250.0] The mean (arithmetic average) of the above set of numbers is 29.4.

[...] Mr. Kuo: I don't recall seeing your byline around much before (at least on t.p.m). Let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated largely by people whose hatred for the U.S. government, especially the government of Mr. Clinton, is literally boundless. To these people, the suggestion that agents of the U.S. government would carry out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of TV cameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. It's just another day in the life of these United States. They don't have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to publicly massacre citizens. Have you seen 'The Crying Game'? "It's in their nature". Don Pajerek	18
# #From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2: # # # # Male sex survey: Gay activity low # # Note this contradictory title- Gay Activity Low. Not really. The percentage of gays was low. Headline writers aren't noted for accuracy. # # A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough # # examination of American men's sexual practices published since # # the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2 # # percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and # # 1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual. # # # #The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners. # #The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3. # # #It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for # #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically # #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are. # #-- # # Now let's take a quick look at what you are saying. # # The median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the # distribution halfway, i.e. 1/2 of the distribution (population) have # lower and half have higher variate-values. # # So for Males 20-39 the median=7.3, this means that half of these men # are higher than this and half are lower than this. Now if the population # sample size is 3300, and 1% of them are gay, 33 males are gay. If we Actually, 2% were either exclusively homosexual, or bisexual. You aren't readiing very carefully. # say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3 # sexual partners, of course, this means that 49.5% heterosexual men are # greater than 7.3. # # Interesting results.	18
THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 20, 1993 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT DURING PRESENTATION OF TEACHER OF THE YEAR AWARD The Rose Garden 1:25 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Please be seated. I want to say, first, how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham. The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving. There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year. And I think both of them would join me in saying that, after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom. That's why today's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important. Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs. He's developed and introduced into Florida's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I might add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's Capital. (Laughter.) Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national and international awards. These advanced programs aren't just for a favored few. Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it. This is what our students need and what our country needs. Today, we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime. The basics aren't enough anymore. All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving. That's why Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments. Tracey, you represent the best in the United States. I'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993. (Applause.) MR. BAILEY: Thank you, Mr. President. It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 2.5 million teachers. And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation's schools. We know that the quality of our children's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come. And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children's education. Thank you again. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: In closing, I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the national education groups who have also come. I'd like to recognize Tracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself a great advocate of education. And I'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children, all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America. They are, in so many ways, our most important public servants. Thank you very much. (Applause.)	18
Peter Nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in talk.politics.misc, so I need not consume more bandwidth here. What I meant, if it was not clear, was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of "natural rights" and how the government (and Constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that philosophy. This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority, completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People. This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days, because He who Controls the Court Rules the Country. The people on the Court may well be trying to do the best job they can, but they are at best a benevolent oligarch, even if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever. Eventually, an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear. Try Supreme Court cases by Jury, and the problem would be mitigated a great deal. Those who would create broad, non-enumerated government powers at any level (as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto standard in the U.S.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake, except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian, virtually unchecked (except by plurality election, death, or retirement), government power. This is like asking why the wind blows, unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities. Very few human activities indeed fit into this category. Even for those few that do, who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity? Who defines "picking my pocket" and "defrauding"? Are economic assets a person's only assets, or are peace of mind, stability, confidence in a child's emotional environment, security, and many other things not also a part of a person's assets? What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to? What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability? If you say that what you do does not have those effects, by what authority do you say that? Who is empowered to make these value judgements? If the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so, the federal government would prevent you from doing so. If it did not, and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local Constitution (by, say, a 3/4 majority) empowering the local government to do so, then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values. This is not an ideal situation, but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now. When you define "rights" very broadly, there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these "rights" overlap. Even when rights are defined very narrowly, the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights. The fundamental question is, by whose authority is that power created. If you support the current situation with a "natural rights" Supreme Court (rather than an "original understanding" Supreme Court or, even better, Supreme Court by Jury), you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington, D.C. create those powers out of the air. In my "Fractal Federalism" scenario, it is a broad consensus of The People (i.e. the amendment process) that creates those powers. No, I mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to tell the locals how to run their neighborhood. Waco, TX is a nice example. If you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the cause of "personal autonomy", have you done anything different? What precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to? If you list them, perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them. The Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power, power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish. The constitutionality of "no-knock" warrants seems very dubious to me, not to mention the mere existence of BATF and the government's propensity to ignore the word "infringe" in the Second Amendment. This power is upheld by the same body, with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people, that has upheld much so-called "Civil Rights" (read- affirmative action) legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment. Money is certainly not the only asset I have in this world. If it were, this would be a bleak existence indeed.

This is the first I hear that Koresh refused to release someone. In fact, a lot of people, including children, came out during the stand-off. How do you know Koresh killed his followers? The FBI said he had had no such plans (and they had the place bugged), Koresh's attorney said the same thing, and the survivors claimed that the fire was started by goverment agents. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: Opinions expressed are mine, not my employer's.	18

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Which is a helluva lot more than any Republican attorney general ever did!

It is interesting, sometimes, to listen to U.S. news as seen through the eyes of another country....... B.B.C. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of London, reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, when making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene lamp and that is how the fire started. Attempts were made by the people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly. Has anyone in U.S. heard anything similar or are U.S. government spin-doctors censoring such information?	18
And this results in a fire that starts in one room and torches the entire place before anyone in the adjacent rooms can escape? I don't think so. So much for the smolder theory.	18
... Oh they'll get it back, with exposed film. :( Shortly after the Rodney King episode, a woman here in Dayton used a camcorder to tape the police arresting several youths. Upon noticing her, the police arrested her (for jaywalking!) and "accidently" erased the tape while they had it. Yep, they'll get their film back allright....	18
Sorry, but this is a red herring. Are you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue Cross? Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between the two sets of forms. Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid, the two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies. (5% versus 14%-16%). If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees, post it. Otherwise, try to stick to factual assertions. Well now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system. Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents private insurance companies from "standardizing?" In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US, but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than "free enterprise" at work. By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a single-payer system is always cheaper...". Guess even the "free enterprise advocates" are beginning to see the light. Sorry, but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care reform with the Bush administration's gag order on federally funded family planning clinics. There are no proposals that would control what your "doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures." Try again. jsh	18
What *exactly* does the American Constitution say about "the right to association" ? Homosexuals, whether Clayton likes it or not, are as much members of society as he is. As such they have the right to participate and have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals. No-one is saying that Clayton should be forced to associate with queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would object also 8-) ), but by proclaiming the general right not to associate with them in the *public* sphere (which includes housing, hiring, etc), he's giving his right to non-association priority over their rights to equal access to opportunity. Historically, people can associate publically with disliked groups with very little ill-effect, however cutting a group off from normal commerce has a severe impact on their lives. Clayton, why exactly should your "right" to non-association in the public sphere take priority over homosexual's rights to equal opportunity ?	18
Oh, please, enlighten us all. What articles in particular are you quoting from? I'm doing my Masters in Psychopathology and it would interest me greatly in seeing these articles that you know exist (yet I know nothing about). I'm sure I could give them to people doing their PhD's. With information like this, they'll have their degree in no time. (sprinkle sarcasm where applicable) Don't bother with the little-girl-is-raped-by-her-daddy-and-is-now- a-lesbian-because-of-it studies. They have always been under critical scrutiny as to their validity. (Correlation != causation).	18
Hehehe! Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements? Clayton, babe, please define the word `molest`. Are you using a legal term or a proper dictionary term? Molest, as far as I can remember, means `to do damage to person(s)`. My mate, Mike, was lured into a woman's parlour when he was 14. Is that molestation? A number of my friends (straight) lost their virginity before that. Were they 'molested'? They told me that they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I see no damage. Please stop pushing your objective morality on others. If you push, people won't fall over and say 'Ye gads, you're right!', they'll just push back. Have you signed up for that logic course yet?	18
+>Critisism is too easy. What solutions do people have that would have been +>better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months? After the seige began: Surround the place with Razor wire and then let them sit. Do not have daily press conferences, do your best to keep things out of the press. As things get more and more miserable inside, one of two things is going to happen: 1. People will start coming out. 2. They will commit suicide in mass at some point. The thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and "assults" play into the hands of a "leader" who has picked this course. Its much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there is gas coming in and bullets in the air. Let them be hungry and miserable for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective. The "possiblity" that they would all kill themselves at some point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics. If people are going to take their own lives, the best you can probably do is prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to do it.	18
Hey, Clayton, it's me again! I just love your arguments. They completely clinch each and _every_ one of your points! But then again, that, I suppose, says a lot about how screwed up your are. Hehe. I haven't had so much fun since I started blasting christians in alt.atheism!	18
Who said it was dead. It seems to be alive and well here on the net.	18
You know, you have a point here, but don't stop with African Americans... When I was in high school in the early 1980s, on various occasions I had knives pulled on me, had friends who were stabbed, and I was beaten up repeatedly by those that couldn't accept me as different. And don't let the teachers off the hook either. On many many occasions, there were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they would just watch quietly... All of this was in a nice white middle class high school. In fact, we were so nice and white that we made sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom with his white girlfriend... This isn't a race thing, it's the way public schools seem to be run... I'd hate to be in high school right now... At least I didn't have to deal with guns, just the roving psycho-drug-dorks and the jocks- without-a-future-but-with-plenty-of-testosterone... I'd separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes... But hey, the valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an American tradition, you think anything is going to change? If you have kids, take 'em out of the public school system and educate them yourself... That's what I'll do if I ever have them... I wouldn't wish what I went through upon any kid... Maybe on some of their parents though...	18

This will not, of course, deter the several die-hard Koreshies on this net, who will probably claim that the Tarrant County medical examiner (Dr. Peerwani) was coerced by the FBI into faking this evidence. Either that, or they'll claim the FBI shot them.

Um, I think you and the Bible are the ones inside the wall. There's a really wonderful world out here. You really should peek out at it sometime. The silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we *are* on opposite sides of a very high wall. I see how incredibly beautiful things are on my side, and I only keep telling you about it because I'd like to you come join me here. I never said that. I said that I would PREFER to cease to exist than to be tossed into any god's version of Hell. You say to me, "Brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage point." But you're in a valley, looking at a crayon drawing of a sun and a tree, and I can't for the life of me figure out why you're so immersed in it. *I*'m the one trying to get you to come up HERE, don't you see?	19
No, Dave, and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this misrepresentation. I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation (science) to religion (see above). I have characterized science/*creation science* as rationalism/nonsense, and that it is. When people promote their religious beliefs as science they become nonsense. Kept where they belong they are meaningful and useful, as virtually any anthropologists will tell you, and as I have said several times in this group. And it works the other way, too, and I have repeatedly said so. Never have I said or meant anything different, here or elsewhere, and I don't think my communication skills betray me. Nor do I presume to offend people's spiritual sensibilities, as I would hope others would not disparage mine.	19
Sorry Malcolm, but I rather believe Jesus than you. Cheers, Kent	19
[Note the "Followup-To" redirect(s) to alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc.] (Timothy J Brent) said in response to P.VASILION: (1) You have no evidence that David Koresh or his followers were "packing" that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that recreational and self-defense purposes. (2) Your statement that "the public also has rights" is correct only is parsed as "the individuals who comprise the public also have rights." There is no separate rights-bearing entity known as "the public". (3) Since the "rights of the public" of which you spoke are in fact only rights of individuals, the statement that the rights of the public should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning. (4) You have artificially created an illusionary conflict of individuals' rights when you speak of "my right to rape your daughter." No person has the right to rape another person, therefore there is no conflict. (5) How do you define "society?" Do you hold that this "society" is a rights-bearing entity which is separate from any individual people? How do you define a "threat to society?" To what extent do you believe that a person loses his rights when he is declared (by whom?) to be such a threat?	19
Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe: The *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured in the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory. The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions. The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation, relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain how they interact... or even why. A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported* by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation, a model. If it is a good model, it may be useful. In science a theory is something that is supported by the evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence. A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not yet enough evidence to support it. When a new hypothesis is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or predict new facts. It is so simple.... I'm surprised that this subject gets beat to death about once a month. A quick glance in a dictionary would clear up 99% of the confusion and bandwidth in this newsgroup. Then we could talk about really important things like, why do men have nipples? -David Utidjian- utidjian@remarque.berkeley.edu	19
This seems appropriate, somehow...>:-)> [....] Hah! I have it on the very *best* authority (mine) that Koresh is whooping it up in a time-share condo in Dallas with Elvis, JFK, and (of course) J.R.

Look for "koresh" sightings in the Weekly World News and National Enquirer in the coming months. ************************************************************ * The_Doge of South St. Louis * * Dobbs-Approved Media Conspirator(tm) * * "One Step Beyond" -- Sundays, 3 to 5 pm * * 88.1 FM St. Louis Community Radio * * "You'll pay to know what you *really* think!" * * -- J.R.

-*---- No. It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture. Whether or not there is some "right" interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god. Dave Davis should note that it was Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread. I think Michael is right in this, but regardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point of contention between Michael and myself. I have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their most important themes are vague. Again, it does not matter that there is some "right" interpretation *unless* there is a way to determine what that "right" interpretation is. It is the lack of an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that puts the force behind the line I argue. There are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently broad range of color, that I can find a few that support my example. In my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity hold dear. He is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely Christian. Those Christians I have called conservative must also interpret, but they do not recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and importance of this. I recognize that Michael is part of the tradition. But what does it tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry Fallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon? Not very much! I think the conclusion does follow. The purely Christian principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian scripture. These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his political stances. That one should love one's neighbor is a purely Christian principle. That this means showing tolerance for homosexuality is *not*. As to these political stances, they are often at odds with what is commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I suspect they could be better pressed outside it. (On the other hand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these political stances become most influential when presented to those who need them most.) -*---- Having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I doubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!	19

Brian Kendig first states: I ask: Brian Kendig states: Make up your mind. And we do not end perfect either. We are never perfect. Can you name one person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect? Good luck. Then you lie to yourself. You do not know your shortcomings. I have clearly shown one of your shortcomings, if not two. That is, ignorance of the Bible and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its contents. Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself. And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not even know what the word "Christ" means. Or which prophet used "Christ" to describe the "Son of Man". Yes. I agree with that. So we must learn first. Read the Bible. Come up with our own interpretation. Evaluate what is being said and by whom. Check the history books as well. Compare someone else's interpretation with your own. Then make a judgment. But I tell you the truth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as much as a coffee cup needs interpretation. And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics. It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said. The Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed to people like you and I. These guys wrote down what they saw and heard. Is it their open diary--and they want to tell you something. And because they want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to know. They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple straight-forward language. You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible. You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn't look appealing to you. You rather build your own road. One that goes far away from that confrontation. But be assured of this, you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. I see what you mean. I hear what your saying. I am not degrading your life. But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years. There is nothing new in what you are saying. And by your own words, you are "spouting off" contradictions. If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must be sad. Bingo. For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life. I look what God *did*. He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has glorious purpose. Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history. You choose to lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for thousands of years. You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19. And the conclusion of that story is a bleak one. Lazarus wound up in hell. The story ends like this: "For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets, he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead." Arrogance at its best. The fact is, you are not rational. Several specific cases have already been cited. And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven. Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven. Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him. Jesus does not expect you to placate either. Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches. Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself. You maintain you have an open mind. See whether you are lying to yourself for yourself. I do understand what you said. But that's is not what I feel went amiss here. You missed the point. Living a "good life" has no eternal consequences. Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end. To you, it is over. To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. But then you contradict yourself. From a previous post, you said doing evil things is bad. To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things. It is all meaningless in the end anyway. So go rob a bank. Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag. What's restraining you? Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant. At which time, you are truly not the master of yourself. So you (and your holy book) say. By the same token, therefore, Santa Claus delivers toys every xmas. Don't you see? I have NO REASON to believe that what you say is true. Please give me some reason that I can't similarly apply to Santa Claus. You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses of Jesus say are true. But you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" the reasons. By definition, "ignorance". Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves and flying reindeer. Ever see a flying reindeer? Has anyone in human history seen a flying reindeer? Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose blinks red? On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem? Was Nebuchandezzar really a king? Was Daniel really one of his court officials? Were David and Solomon really kings of Israel and Judah? Was their really a king called Jehoachin? Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ? Did Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly? Was there really a Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus? Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies it. It is NONFICTION. Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction? Perhaps you can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from that of the Scientific American. I suppose you treat both with equal truthfulness or equal falsity. Is this what you are telling me? Or is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out that it's not a fairy tale? Get real. Have you ever been to Zaire? Do you have to go there to be assured that there really is such a place? Given your irrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.	19
Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that, in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status.] Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade: DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name. Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel 7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3). The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example, Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith. The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a "son of man" invested with rule (this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12. The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent. The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation. Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.	19
This morning on CNN (tues April 27), Texas Cops say Arson is suspected because of two falsh points. CNN also stated that _all_ surviors claim the fires are FBI set. Your argument are made-up, untrue and unverified at best. The day of the attack the FBI claimed to have seen two BD'ers setting the fire outside of the compound. Yesterday, the arson squad said two flash points at the or near the tank entry points Not good evidence for the FBI hit squad. is there a difference between thinking that you won't survive a confrontation with the FBI (parnoia?) and committing suicide? No, claimed by the escapees not contradicted What I'm finding interesting is the conflicting reports. FBI says that bodies have been found with bullet wounds and the Texas Cornuers (sp) says that they haven't yet found any bullet holes..	19

If the children are not being fed, whose fault is that? You and I have plenty of food on our tables while others starve. Why is that? God gave us this earth to manage. I don't think we're doing a very good job of it. The only consolation I have for those suffering children is that they will be received into the kingdom of Heaven where they will never thirst and never hunger again. Peace be with you, Malcolm Lee :)	19
Well, where is he? Another false Messiah shot down in flames. Matthew 24:4 "Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ', and will deceive many." Matthew 24:23 "At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect - if that were possible. See, I have told you ahead of time." Do we listen? Sadly, not all of us do. Peace be with you, and condolences to the families of those lost at Waco. Malcolm Lee	19

^^-- name? Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself. Are you the spokesman for "most people?" That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used. Those in the church know the language though, and have no such excuse. You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and Revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special event -- a wedding. How are you able to make such a conclusion? Please note, that the first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those in the church. That said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church. So you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators conclude, and what the final judgments are. So much for war and government eh. Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19: (here from NIV) Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly. It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am chains. But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are human and imperfect. Whatever we "preach," no matter how eloquent, or how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the lesson of the "stumblingblock." For those who have an ear to hear.	19
No, this is far from clear. We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor made this claim. We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire. In the absense of any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe. Furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else. With the state of the area now, we may never know what happened. Again, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim. The lawyers who have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim. I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities. Its more likely that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI. But there is currently NO way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence (which is nearly none). D. The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs. I am truely amazed that I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility. With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside. I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over. With the winds, it would have quickly gotten out of control. No, I think that D is also quite reasonable. I personally can't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or BD) over intential setting of the fire). I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds. The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions. He pointed out that under intense heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard. In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday. We should remain skeptical until more information is available. --	19

The point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with what reality might be when one wants predictions. The questions if the atoms are there or if something else is there making measurements indicate atoms is not necessary in such a system. And one does not have to write a new theory of existence everytime new models are used in Physics.	19
#Recently, I've asked myself a rather interesting question: What RIGHT does #god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god, of course...!) ?? # #In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live #according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god #make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates #every one of us (directly or indirectly, it doesn't matter.). What then #happens, is that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't #ask to be created. # #Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature #(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the #right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...? Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions, but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents. As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you, me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9) in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression, an earthly probationary time was required. (To live by faith, not by sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance.) We believe that all of God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn. One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ). Lucifer's aspirations ("I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ." Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven ("And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth . . ." Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits). To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices), we made that choice individually. (God speaking to Job: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7). We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the "Veil of Forgetful- ness," somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight. You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God. #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep, #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. (All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd as they understand Him ;-) --But in any event, not all Christians believe in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in. (They will cry "heresy" and other accusations of "perverting" the doctrines of the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...) As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not least, modern-day revelation on the subject. #I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it. # # How should one deal with a man who is convinced that # he is acting according to God's will, and who there- # Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by # stabbing you in the back? # # -Voltaire	19

The thing is, I know what arms and legs are. It's therefore generally easy to tell whether or not someone has arms and legs. This "sinful nature", since it does not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally invisible. As far as I know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and half don't--it'd look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the difference. So what's so bad about a sinful nature, then? I could understand it being bad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it, never commit sins, die, and they still have it. So the bad part about can't merely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it? -- "On the first day after Christmas my truelove served to me... Leftover Turkey!

qpalo@digi.lonestar.org (Gerry Palo) For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and misleading innuendos as part of their exposes. A recent book on cults I picked up by a "Christian" author quite simply mixed in all non-Christian religions (except the Jews) and various New Age groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality. Given the record of American Christianity, any group that falls into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically into the Inquisition business. It is an unavoidable affliction of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth (tm). And let's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod Lutherans, and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers.

The pain does not fill my entire body, and I'm told the longer I hold it here, the less it'll hurt (it'll eventually burn up the nerves, or so I'm told). So I suppose I should just ignore the pain, because holding my hand over the candle is something I just want to do. I've got the right, don't I? Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong. It's your body's alarm system informing you that something needs your attention. A fever tells you that you are sick, and need some sort of care. Guilt can be seen as that "emotional or spiritual" alarm, just informing you that there is something that you've done that "requires your attention".

Welcome to the Peace Run You're invited to join in a Global Relay Run... and help light the Way. ---- Why the Peace Run ---- There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing belief in the possibility of true global peace. The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into a reality in their own lives. Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand - join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe. Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying the message of brotherhood to all humankind. Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth. ---- Making History ---- The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break- throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian- Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace; and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II. ---- Speaking as One: World ---- ---- Leaders, Celebrities - and You ---- The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over - Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and entertainment personalities. Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show. reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human family, God's family." - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Peace Prize Winner ---- How It All Works ---- Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch. From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered: 31,000 miles. the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear about the event." - Carl Lewis, Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist ---- Who's Behind It ---- The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an international running organization that believes sports can be a powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries. The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace, offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless world figures to advance the cause of international harmony. The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit organization based in the United States. ---- Take a Step For Peace ---- The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a million participants. We're expecting even more people to join Peace Run '93. You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps, a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the runners as they carry the Torch through your community. You can also join local celebrities and government officials in one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the 70-nation route. Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace. ---- The Next Step is Yours ---- ---- Make It One For Peace ---- For information contact: Peace Runs International 161-44 Normal Road Jamaica, NY 11432 USA tel. 718/291-6637 Fax: 718/291-6978 Peace Run Canada 2456 Agricola Street Halifax, Nova Scotia B3K 4C2 tel. 902/425-1174 Fax: 902/420-0773	19

(st) Stephen Tice (km) Ken McVay (st)Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed (st)for the message he carried. (Which says nothing about the (km)Seems to be, barring evidence to the contrary, that Koresh was simply (km)another deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of (km)folks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim (km)Jones, circa 1993. I think there's plenty of evidence to the contrary - six "rescued" Davidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel of propane. These guys haven't exactly been spending time together, plotting an elaborate and consistent story. It would be contradictory for Koresh to go for "mass suicide" - remember that Koresh's death was the opening of the sixth seal - the signal that Armageddon had begun. His army (the people in the compound) would then fight the powers of evil and win, ending in the Rapture. The fire wiped out his army. I read earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound and blow himself up with a grenade - that would jibe better with his teachings. (st)In the mean time, we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption. (st)Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten? (km)Nope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption (km)for centuries. I'd think you'd be the last one to support gassing people and burning them to death for their religious beliefs. Corrupt? Evil? I don't know. We'll never know. And when you start calling people fruitcakes about their religious beliefs, that's dehumanizing people. We saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews were subhuman. In one neat stroke, they destroyed all the evidence that could have pointed to wrongdoing. And killed all the witnesses, including 12 children whose last view of life was choking and pain, followed by burning them alive. I am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred. I'm furious that they used my money to do it.	19

Dear netters I am wondering about the accident of Koresh. I have heard different explanations.

(Or what was his message) 2)- What was the main reason that Government went in war with Koresh? (Some say that due to Tax payment, ....) Thanks in advance for your historical explanation.	19
In <1993Apr24.214843.10940@midway.uchicago.edu> eeb1@quads.uchicago.edu I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause me to make another, independent reply. The problem with a "moment of silence" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of "allowing" for religion amongst students in the public schools. As I noted before, Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do. And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this. There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this "moment of silence" shit. And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it.) A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others. That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant "mainstream" religion. All that a "moment of silence" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it, to have a "special" place set aside in the public schools. There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs, or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world. A Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during the day, without anyone else knowing it. [That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise]. In the "moment of silence" it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms. But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore, the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that. Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools), and a growing Muslim presence as well. I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians. As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this "moment of silence" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity. And as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion. For what it's worth, I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in "making" their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so. If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of silence in school. If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment will only embarrass you. Give it up.	19

Uh oh, Michael; you typed "hell" and capitalized it to boot! Now Peter Nyikos will explain that you're not a real Christian! BZZT! Sorry Michael--the Nyikos Inquisition pointed out that I was hell-bound after one mildly scurrilous pun on "revealing oneself." Admitting to masturbation--well, I'm just shocked!	19
Tell me are you really this stupid, or are you just pretending. A fire insurance is not an offensive weapon. A spare tire is not an offensive weapon. How should one deal with a man who is convinced that he is acting according to God's will, and who there- Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by stabbing you in the back?	19
